<h1>THE<br />
DECAMERON</h1>

<h2>CONTAINING<br />
An hundred pleasant<br />
Novels.</h2>

<h3><i>Wittily discoursed, betweene<br />
seven Honourable Ladies, and<br />
three Noble Gentlemen.</i></h3>


<h4>The last Five Dayes.</h4>


<h4>London, Printed by<br />
Isaac Jaggard,<br />
1620.</h4>

<h2><a name="TO_THE_RIGHT_HONOURABLE" id="TO_THE_RIGHT_HONOURABLE">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
Sir <span class="smcap">Phillip Herbert</span>,</a></h2>
<h4>Knight, Lord Baron of Sherland, Earle of
Montgomery, and Knight of the most Noble
order of the Garter.</h4>


<p><i>Having (by your Honorable command)
translated this</i> Decameron, <i>or</i> Cento
Novelle, <i>sirnamed</i> Il Principe
Galeotto, <i>of ten dayes severall discourses,
grounded on variable and singuler
Arguments, happening betweene
seaven Noble Ladies, and three very
Honourable Gentlemen: Although not attyred in such elegantcy
of phrase, or nice curiosity of stile, as a quicker and more
sprightly wit could have performed, but in such home-borne
language, as my ability could stretch unto; yet it commeth (in
all duty) to kisse your Noble hand, and to shelter it selfe under
your Gracious protection, though not from the leering eye, and
over-lavish tongue of snarling Envy; yet from the power of his
blasting poyson, and malice of his machinations.</i></p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="To_the_Reader" id="To_the_Reader"><i>To the Reader.</i></a></h2>


<p>Bookes (Courteous Reader) may
rightly be compared to <i>Gardens</i>;
wherein, let the painfull Gardiner
expresse never so much care and
diligent endeavour; yet among
the very fairest, sweetest, and freshest
Flowers, as also Plants of
most precious Vertue; ill favouring and stinking
Weeds, fit for no use but the fire or mucke-hill, will
spring and sprout up. So fareth it with Bookes of the
very best quality, let the Author bee never so indulgent,
and the Printer vigilant: yet both may misse
their ayme, by the escape of Errors and Mistakes, either
in sense or matter, the one fault ensuing by a ragged
Written Copy; and the other thorough want of
wary Correction. If then the best Bookes cannot be
free from this common infirmity; blame not this
then, of farre lighter argument, wherein thy courtesie
may helpe us both: His blame, in acknowledging
his more sufficiency, then to write so grosse and absurdly:
And mine, in pardoning unwilling Errors
committed, which thy judgement finding, thy pen
can as easily correct.</p>

Eliza.</a></h3>


<p><i>Wherein the Discourses or Novels there to bee
recounted, doe concerne such persons; who by
some witty words (when any have taunted
them) have revenged themselves, in a sudden,
unexpected and discreet answere, thereby preventing
losse, danger, scorne and disgrace, retorting
them on the busi-headed Questioners.</i></p>

<p><i>A Knight requested Madame</i> Oretta, <i>to ride behinde

<i>by a sodaine pleasant answere which he made to his Master;
converted his anger into laughter, and thereby escaped
the punishment, that</i> Messer <i>meant to impose on him.</i></p>

<h4><i>The Morall.</i></h4>

and merry answere, doth oftentimes appease the furious
choller of an angry man.</p>


<h4><a href="#Messer_Forese_da_Rabatte_and_Maister_Giotto_a_Painter_by_his_profession">The Argument of the fift Novell.</a></h4>

answere, and moderated a severe strict Statute, formerly
made against women.</i></p>

<h4><i>The Morall.</i></h4>

apprehension.</p>

doe many times passe, under the counterfeit Cloake
of Religion.</p>

sword in his hand, and (by that meanes) made an excuse sufficient
for</i> Lionello <i>to her Husband.</i></p>

Simonida, <i>who fastened a thred about her great toe, for to serve as a

<i>findeth the fallacy, and while he pursueth the amorous friend, shee
causeth her Maide to lie in her bed against his returne: whom he beateth
extreamly, cutting away the lockes of her haire (thinking he had
done all this violence to his Wife</i> Simonida:) <i>and afterward fetcheth
her Mother and Brethren, to shame her before them, and so be rid of
her. But they finding all his speeches to be false; and reputing him to be
a drunken jealous foole; all the blame and disgrace falleth on himselfe.</i></p>

<h4><i>The Morall.</i></h4>

<p>Whereby appeareth, that an Husband ought to be very well advised,
when he meaneth to discover any wrong offered by his Wife; except he

false.</i></p>

<h4><i>The Morall.</i></h4>

afterward to his companion, according as he had formerly promised
him to doe, and told him what strange wonders he had seene in the other
world.</i></p>

<h4><i>The Morall.</i></h4>

Geneway, <i>he told him in the presence of his wife, how hee had payde
the whole summe to her, with charge of delivering it to her Husband,
which she confessed to be true, albeit greatly against her will.</i></p>

<h4><i>The Morall.</i></h4>

afterward, he borrowed a morter of her, which when hee sent home againe
in the presence of her husband, he demanded to have his Cloake
sent him, as having left it in pawne for the Morter. To pacifie her Husband,
offended that she did not lend the Priest the Morter without a
pawne: she sent him backe his Cloake againe, albeit greatly against hir

<h4><i>Governed under the Authority of Madam Eliza, and the Argument of the
Discourses or Novels there to be recounted, doe concerne such persons; who
by some witty words (when any have checkt or taunted them) have revenged
themselves, in a sudden, unexpected and discreet answere, thereby
preventing loss, danger, scorne and disgrace, retorting them on the busi-headed
Questioners.</i></h4>

<h4>The Induction.</h4>


<p>The Moone having past the heaven, lost
her bright splendor, by the arising of a
more powerfull light, and every part of
our world began to looke cleare: when
the Queene (being risen) caused all the
Company to be called, walking forth afterward
upon the pearled dewe (so farre
as was supposed convenient) in faire and
familiar conference together, according
as severally they were disposed, &amp; repetition
of divers the passed Novels, especially
those which were most pleasing, and seemed so by their present commendations.
But the Sunne beeing somewhat higher mounted, gave
such a sensible warmth to the ayre, as caused their returne backe to the
Pallace, where the Tables were readily covered against their comming,
strewed with sweet hearbes and odoriferous flowers, seating themselves
at the Tables (before the heat grew more violent) according as the
Queene commanded.</p>

<p>After dinner, they sung divers excellent Canzonnets, and then some
went to sleepe, others played at the Chesse, and some at the Tables:
But <i>Dioneus</i> and Madam <i>Lauretta</i>, they sung the love-conflict betweene
<i>Troylus</i> and <i>Cressida</i>. Now was the houre come, of repairing to their
former Consistory or meeting place, the Queene having thereto generally
summoned them, and seating themselves (as they were wont to doe)
about the faire fountaine. As the Queene was commanding to begin
the first Novell, an accident suddenly happened, which never had befalne
before: to wit, they heard a great noyse and tumult, among the
houshold servants in the Kitchin. Whereupon, the Queene caused the
Master of the Houshold to be called, demaunding of him, what noyse it
was, and what might be the occasion thereof? He made answere, that
<i>Lacisca</i> and <i>Tindaro</i> were at some words of discontentment, but what
was the occasion thereof, he knew not. Whereupon, the Queene commanded
that they should be sent for, (their anger and violent speeches
still continuing) and being come into her presence, she demaunded the
reason of their discord; and <i>Tindaro</i> offering to make answere, <i>Lacisca</i>
(being somewhat more ancient then he, and of a fiercer fiery spirit, even
as if her heart would have leapt out of her mouth) turned her selfe to
him, and with a scornefull frowning countenance, said. See how this
bold, unmannerly and beastly fellow, dare presume to speake in this
place before me: Stand by (saucy impudence) and give your better
leave to answere; then turning to the Queene, thus shee proceeded.</p>

<p>Madam, this idle fellow would maintaine to me, that Signior <i>Sicophanto</i>
marrying with <i>Madama della Grazza</i>, had the victory of her virginity
the very first night: and I avouched the contrary, because shee
had been a mother twise before, in very faire adventuring of her fortune.
And he dared to affirme beside, that young Maides are so simple, as
to loose the flourishing Aprill of their time, in meere feare of their parents,
and great prejudice of their amourous friends. Onely being abused
by infinite promises, that this yeare and that yeare they shall have
husbands, when, both by the lawes of nature and reason, they are not
tyed to tarry so long, but rather ought to lay hold upon opportunity,
when it is fairely and friendly offered, so that seldome they come maides
to marriage. Beside, I have heard, and know some married wives, that
have played divers wanton prancks with their husbands, yet carried all
so demurely and smoothly; that they have gone free from publique detection.
All which this woodcocke will not credit, thinking me to be so
young a Novice, as if I had been borne but yesterday.</p>

<p>While <i>Lacisca</i> was delivering these speeches, the Ladies smiled on
one another, not knowing what to say in this case: And although the
Queene (five and or severall times) commaunded her to silence; yet
such was the earnestnes of her spleen, that she gave no attention, but held
on still even untill she had uttered all that she pleased. But after she had
concluded her complaint, the Queene (with a smiling countenance)
turned towards <i>Dioneus</i> saying. This matter seemeth most properly to
belong to you; and therefore I dare repose such trust in you, that when
our Novels (for this day) shall be ended, you will conclude the case
with a definitive sentence. Whereto <i>Dioneus</i> presently thus replyed.
Madam, the verdict is already given, without any further expectation:
and I affirme, that <i>Lacisca</i> hath spoken very sensibly, because shee is a
woman of good apprehension, and <i>Tindaro</i> is but a puny, in practise and
experience, to her.</p>

<p>When <i>Lacisca</i> heard this, she fell into a lowd Laughter, and turning
her selfe to <i>Tindaro</i>, sayde: The honour of the day is mine, and
thine owne quarrell hath overthrowne thee in the fielde. Thou that
(as yet) hath scarsely learned to sucke, wouldest thou presume to know
so much as I doe? Couldst thou imagine mee, to be such a trewant in
losse of my time, that I came hither as an ignorant creature? And had
not the Queene (looking verie frowningly on her) strictly enjoyned
her to silence; shee would have continued still in this triumphing humour.
But fearing further chastisement for disobedience, both shee
and <i>Tindaro</i> were commanded thence, where was no other allowance
all this day, but onely silence and attention, to such as should be enjoyned
speakers.</p>

<p>And then the Queene, somewhat offended at the folly of the former
controversie, commanded Madame <i>Philomena</i>, that she should give beginning
to the dayes Novels: which (in dutifull manner) shee undertooke
to doe, and seating her selfe in formall fashion, with modest and
very gracious gesture, thus she began.</p>

to the heavens, and the flowry fields (so long as

the Trees likewise bragging in their best
adornings: Even so at friendly meetings, short,
sweet, and sententious words, are the beauty &amp;
ornament of any discourse, savouring of wit and
sound judgement, worthily deserving to be commended. And so much
the rather, because in few and witty words, aptly suting with the time

<p>True it is, what the occasion may be, I know not, either by the badnesse
of our wittes, or the especiall enmitie betweene our complexions
and the celestiall bodies: there are scarsely any, or very few Women to
be found among us, that well knowes how to deliver a word, when it
should and ought to be spoken; or, if a question bee mooved, understands
to suite it with an apt answere, such as conveniently is required,
which is no meane disgrace to us women. But in regard, that Madame
<i>Pampinea</i> hath already spoken sufficiently of this matter, I meane not to
presse it any further: but at this time it shall satisfie mee, to let you
know, how wittily a Ladie made due observation of opportunitie,
in answering of a Knight, whose talke seemed tedious and offensive to
her.</p>

<p>No doubt there are some among you, who either do know, or (at
the least) have heard, that it is no long time since, when there dwelt a
Gentlewoman in our Citie, of excellent grace and good discourse, with
all other rich endowments of Nature remaining in her, as pitty it were
to conceale her name: and therefore let me tell ye, that shee was called
Madame <i>Oretta</i>, the Wife to Signior <i>Geri Spina</i>. She being upon some
occasion (as now we are) in the Countrey, and passing from place to
place (by way of neighbourly invitations) to visite her loving Friends
and Acquaintance, accompanied with divers Knights and Gentlewomen,
who on the day before had dined and supt at her house, as now
(belike) the selfe-same courtesie was intended to her: walking along with
her company upon the way; and the place for her welcome beeing further
off then she expected: a Knight chanced to overtake this faire troop,
who well knowing Madam <i>Oretta</i>, using a kinde and courteous salutation,
spake thus unto her.</p>

<p>Madam, this foot travell may bee offensive to you, and were you so
well pleased as my selfe, I would ease your journey behinde mee on my
Gelding, even so farre as you shall command me: and beside, wil shorten
your wearinesse with a Tale worth the hearing. Courteous Sir (replyed
the Lady) I embrace your kinde offer with such acceptation, that
I pray you to performe it; for therein you shall doe me an especiall favour.
The Knight, whose Sword (perhappes) was as unsuteable to
his side, as his wit out of fashion for any readie discourse, having the
Lady mounted behinde him: rode on with a gentle pace, and (according
to his promise) began to tell a Tale, which indeede (of it selfe) deserved
attention, because it was a knowne and commendable History,
but yet delivered so abruptly, with idle repetitions of some particulars
three or foure severall times, mistaking one thing for another, and
wandering erroneously from the essentiall subject, seeming neere an
end, and then beginning againe: that a poore Tale could not possibly
be more mangled, or worse tortured in telling, then this was; for the
persons therein concerned, were so abusively nicke-named, their actions
and speeches so monstrously misshapen, that nothing could appeare
to be more ugly.</p>

<p>Madame <i>Oretta</i>, being a Lady of unequalled ingenuitie, admirable
in judgement, and most delicate in her speech, was afflicted in soule, beyond
all measure; overcome with many colde sweates, and passionate
heart-aking qualmes, to see a Foole thus in a Pinne-fold, and unable to
get out, albeit the doore stood wide open to him, whereby shee became
so sicke; that, converting her distaste to a kinde of pleasing acceptation,
merrily thus she spake. Beleeve me Sir, your horse trots so hard, &amp; travels
so uneasily; that I entreate you to let me walke on foot againe.</p>

<p>The Knight, being (perchance) a better understander, then a Discourser;
perceived by this witty taunt, that his Bowle had run a contrarie
bias, and he as farre out of Tune, as he was from the Towne. So,
lingering the time, untill her company was neerer arrived: hee lefte
her with them, and rode on as his Wisedome could best direct him.</p>

<i>caused him to acknowledge a very indiscreete motion, which he had made
to the said</i> Cistio.</a></h4>

<h2>The Second Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Approving, that a request ought to be civill, before it should be granted to any
one whatsoever.</i></h4>


<p>The words of Madame <i>Oretta</i>, were much commended by the
men and women; and the discourse being ended, the Queene
gave command to Madam <i>Pampinea</i>, that shee should follow
next in order, which made her to begin in this manner.</p>

<p>Worthy Ladies, it exceedeth the power of my capacitie, to censure
in the case whereof I am to speake, by saying, who sinned most, either
Nature, in seating a Noble soule in a vile body, or Fortune, in bestowing
on a body (beautified with a noble soule) a base or wretched condition
of life. As we may observe by <i>Cistio</i>, a Citizen of our owne, and
many more beside; for, this <i>Cistio</i> beeing endued with a singular good
spirit, Fortune hath made him no better then a Baker. And beleeve me
Ladies, I could (in this case) lay as much blame on Nature, as on Fortune;
if I did not know Nature to be most absolutely wise, &amp; that Fortune
hath a thousand eyes, albeit fooles have figured her to bee blinde.
But, upon more mature and deliberate consideration, I finde, that they
both (being truly wise and judicious) have dealt justly, in imitation of
our best advised mortals, who being uncertaine of such inconveniences,
as may happen unto them, do bury (for their own benefit) the very best
and choisest things of esteeme, in the most vile and abject places of their
houses, as being subject to least suspition, and where they may be sure to
have them at all times, for supply of any necessitie whatsoever, because
so base a conveyance hath better kept them, then the very best chamber
in the house could have done. Even so these two great commanders of
the world, do many times hide their most precious Jewels of worth, under
the clouds of Arts or professions of worst estimation, to the end, that
fetching them thence when neede requires, their splendor may appeare
to be the more glorious. Nor was any such matter noted in our homely
Baker <i>Cistio</i>, by the best observation of <i>Messer Geri Spina</i>, who was spoken
of in the late repeated Novell, as being the husband to Madame <i>Oretta</i>;
whereby this accident came to my remembrance, and which (in a
short Tale) I will relate unto you.</p>

<p>Let me then tell ye, that Pope <i>Boniface</i> (with whom the fore-named
<i>Messer Geri Spina</i> was in great regard) having sent divers Gentlemen of
his Court to <i>Florence</i> as Ambassadors, about very serious and important
businesse: they were lodged in the house of <i>Messer Geri Spina</i>, and
he employed (with them) in the saide Popes negotiation. It chanced,
that as being the most convenient way for passage, every morning they
walked on foot by the Church of Saint <i>Marie d'Ughi</i>, where <i>Cistio</i> the
Baker dwelt, and exercised the trade belonging to him. Now although
Fortune had humbled him to so meane a condition, yet shee added a
blessing of wealth to that contemptible quality, and (as smiling on him
continually) no disasters at any time befell him, but still he flourished in
riches, lived like a jolly Citizen, with all things fitting for honest entertainment
about him, and plenty of the best Wines (both White and
Claret) as <i>Florence</i>, or any part thereabout yeelded.</p>

<p>Our frolicke Baker perceiving, that <i>Messer Geri Spina</i> and the other
Ambassadors, used every morning to passe by his doore, and afterward
to returne backe the same way: seeing the season to be somewhat hot &amp;
soultry, he tooke it as an action of kindnesse and courtesie, to make them
an offer of tasting his white wine. But having respect to his own meane
degree, and the condition of <i>Messer Geri</i>; hee thought it farre unfitting
for him, to be so forward in such presumption; but rather entred into
consideration of some such meanes, whereby <i>Messer Geri</i> might bee the
inviter of himselfe to taste his Wine. And having put on him a trusse
or thin doublet, of very white and fine Linnen cloath, as also breeches,
and an apron of the same, and a white cap upon his head, so that he seemed
rather to be a Miller, then a Baker: at such times as <i>Messer Geri</i> and
the Ambassadors should daily passe by, hee set before his doore a new
Bucket of faire water, and another small vessell of <i>Bologna</i> earth (as new
and sightly as the other) full of his best and choisest white Wine, with
two small Glasses, looking like silver, they were so cleare. Downe he
sate, with all this provision before him, and emptying his stomacke
twice or thrice, of some clotted flegmes which seemed to offend it: even
as the Gentlemen were passing by, he dranke one or two rouses of his
Wine so heartily, and with such a pleasing appetite, as might have moved
a longing (almost) in a dead man.</p>

<p><i>Messer Geri</i> well noting his behaviour, and observing the verie same
course in him two mornings together; on the third day (as he was drinking)
he said unto him. Well done <i>Cistio</i>, what, is it good, or no? <i>Cistio</i>
starting up, forthwith replyed: Yes Sir, the wine is good indeed, but how
can I make you to beleeve me, except you taste of it? <i>Messer Geri</i>, eyther
in regard of the times quality, or by reason of his paines taken, perhaps
more then ordinary, or else, because hee saw <i>Cistio</i> had drunke so
sprightly, was very desirous to taste of the Wine, and turning unto the
Ambassadors, in merriment he saide. My Lords, me thinks it were not
much amisse, if we tooke a taste of this honest mans Wine, perhaps it is
so good, that we shall not neede to repent our labour.</p>

<p>Heereupon, he went with them to <i>Cistio</i>, who had caused an handsome
seate to be fetched forth of his house, whereon he requested them
to sit downe, and having commanded his men to wash cleane the Glasses,
he saide. Fellowes, now get you gone, and leave me to the performance
of this service; for I am no worse a skinker, then a Baker, and tarry
you never so long, you shall not drinke a drop. Having thus spoken,
himselfe washed foure or five small glasses, faire and new, and causing a
Viall of his best wine to be brought him: hee diligently filled it out to
<i>Messer Geri</i> and the Ambassadours, to whom it seemed the very best
Wine, that they had drunke of in a long while before. And having given
<i>Cistio</i> most hearty thankes for his kindnesse, and the Wine his due
commendation: many dayes afterwardes (so long as they continued
there) they found the like courteous entertainment, and with the good
liking of honest <i>Cistio</i>.</p>

<p>But when the affayres were fully concluded, for which they were thus
sent to <i>Florence</i>, and their parting preparation in due readinesse: <i>Messer
Geri</i> made a very sumptuous Feast for them, inviting thereto the most
part of the honourablest Citizens, and <i>Cistio</i> to be one amongst them;
who (by no meanes) would bee seene in an assembly of such State and
pompe, albeit he was thereto (by the saide <i>Messer Geri</i>) most earnestly
entreated.</p>

<p>In regard of which deniall, <i>Messer Geri</i> commaunded one of his servants,
to take a small Bottle, and request <i>Cistio</i> to fill it with his good
Wine; then afterward, to serve it in such sparing manner to the Table,
that each Gentleman might be allowed halfe a glasse-full at their down-sitting.
The Serving-man, who had heard great report of the Wine,
and was halfe offended, because he could never taste thereof: tooke a
great Flaggon Bottle, containing foure or five Gallons at the least, and
comming there-with unto <i>Cistio</i>, saide unto him. <i>Cistio</i>, because my
Master cannot have your companie among his friends, he prayes you
to fill this Bottle with your best Wine. <i>Cistio</i> looking uppon the huge
Flaggon, replied thus. Honest Fellow, <i>Messer Geri</i> never sent thee
with such a Message to me: which although the Servingman very stoutly
maintained, yet getting no other answer, he returned backe therewith
to his Master.</p>

<p><i>Messer Geri</i> returned the Servant backe againe unto <i>Cistio</i>, saying:
Goe, and assure <i>Cistio</i>, that I sent thee to him, and if hee make thee any
more such answeres, then demaund of him, to what place else I
should send thee? Being come againe to <i>Cistio</i>, hee avouched that his
Maister had sent him, but <i>Cistio</i> affirming, that hee did not: the Servant
asked, to what place else hee should send him? Marrie (quoth
<i>Cistio</i>) unto the River of <i>Arno</i>, which runneth by <i>Florence</i>, there thou
mayest be sure to fill thy Flaggon. When the Servant had reported
this answer to <i>Messer Geri</i>, the eyes of his understanding beganne to open,
and calling to see what Bottle hee had carried with him: no sooner
looked he on the huge Flaggon,
but severely reproving the
sawcinesse of his Servant, hee
sayde. Now trust mee, <i>Cistio</i>
told thee nothing but trueth, for
neither did I send thee with any
such dishonest message, nor had
the reason to yeeld or grant it.</p>

<p>Then he sent him with a bottle
of more reasonable competencie,
which so soone as <i>Cistio</i>
saw: Yea mary my friend, quoth
he, now I am sure that thy Master
sent thee to me, and he shall
have his desire with all my hart.
So, commaunding the Bottle to
be filled, he sent it away by the
Servant, and presently following
after him, when he came unto <i>Messer Geri</i>, he spake unto him after
this manner. Sir, I would not have you to imagine, that the huge flaggon
(which first came) did any jotte dismay mee; but rather I conceyved,
that the small Viall whereof you tasted every morning, yet filled many
mannerly Glasses together, was fallen quite out of your remembrance;
in plainer tearmes, it beeing no Wine for Groomes or Peazants,
as your selfe affirmed yesterday. And because I meane to bee
a Skinker no longer, by keeping Wine to please any other pallate
but mine owne: I have sent you halfe my store, and heereafter thinke
of mee as you shall please. <i>Messer Geri</i> tooke both his guifte and
speeches in most thankefull manner, accepting him alwayes after, as
his intimate Friend, because he had so graced him before the Ambassadours.</p>

<h2>The Third Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is declared, that mockers do sometimes meete with their matches in
mockery, and to their owne shame.</i></h4>


<p>When Madame <i>Pampinea</i> had ended her Discourse, and
(by the whole company) the answere and bounty of <i>Cistio</i>,
had past with deserved commendation: it pleased
the Queene, that Madame <i>Lauretta</i> should next succeed:
whereupon verie chearefully thus she beganne.</p>

<p>Faire assembly, Madame <i>Pampinea</i> (not long time since) gave beginning,
and Madam <i>Philomena</i> hath also seconded the same argument,
concerning the slender vertue remaining in our sexe, and likewise the
beautie of wittie words, delivered on apt occasion, and in convenient
meetings. Now, because it is needlesse to proceede any further, then
what hath beene already spoken: let mee onely tell you (over and beside)
and commit it to memorie, that the nature of meetings and speeches
are such, as they ought to nippe or touch the hearer, like unto the
Sheepes nibling on the tender grasse, and not as the sullen Dogge byteth.
For, if their biting be answereable to the Dogges, they deserve
not to be termed witty jests or quips, but foule and offensive language:
as plainly appeareth by the words of Madame <i>Oretta</i>, and the merry, yet
sensible answer of <i>Cistio</i>.</p>

<p>True it is, that if it be spoken by way of answer, and the answerer biteth
doggedly, because himselfe was bitten in the same manner before:
he is the lesse to bee blamed, because hee maketh payment but with
coine of the same stampe. In which respect, an especiall care is to bee
had, how, when, with whom, and where we jest or gibe, whereof very
many proove too unmindfull, as appeared (not long since) by a Prelate
of ours, who met with a byting, no lesse sharpe and bitter, then
had first come from himselfe before, as verie briefely I intend to tell
you how.</p>

<p><i>Messer Antonio d'Orso</i>, being Byshoppe of <i>Florence</i>, a vertuous, wise,
and reverend Prelate; it fortuned that a Gentleman of <i>Catalogna</i>, named
<i>Messer Diego de la Ratta</i>, and Lord Marshall to King <i>Robert</i> of <i>Naples</i>,
came thither to visite him. Hee being a man of very comely personage,
and a great observer of the choysest beauties in Court: among
all the other <i>Florentine</i> Dames, one proved to bee most pleasing in his
eye, who was a verie faire Woman indeede, and Neece to the Brother
of the saide <i>Messer Antonio</i>.</p>

<p>The Husband of this Gentlewoman (albeit descended of a worthie
Family) was, neverthelesse, immeasurably covetous, and a verie vile
harsh natured man. Which the Lord Marshall understanding, made
such a madde composition with him, as to give him five hundred Ducates
of Gold, on condition, that hee would let him lye one night with
his wife, not thinking him so base minded as to give consent. Which in
a greedy avaritious humour he did, and the bargaine being absolutely agreed
on; the Lord Marshall prepared to fit him with a payment, such
as it should be. He caused so many peeces of silver to be cunningly guilded,
as then went for currant mony in <i>Florence</i>, and called <i>Popolines</i>, &amp;
after he had lyen with the Lady (contrary to her will and knowledge,
her husband had so closely carried the businesse) the money was duely
paid to the cornuted Coxcombe. Afterwards, this impudent shame
chanced to be generally knowne, nothing remaining to the wilful Wittoll,
but losse of his expected gaine, and scorne in every place where he
went. The Bishop likewise (beeing a discreete and sober man) would
seeme to take no knowledge thereof; but bare out all scoffes with a well
setled countenance.</p>

<p>Within a short while after, the Bishop and the Lord Marshal (alwaies
conversing together) it came to passe, that upon Saint <i>Johns</i> day, they
riding thorow the City, side by side, and viewing the brave beauties,
which of them might best deserve to win the prize; the Byshop espied a
young married Lady (which our late greevous pestilence bereaved us of)
she being named Madame <i>Nonna de Pulci</i>, and Cousine to <i>Messer Alexio
Rinucci</i>, a Gentleman well knowne unto us all. A very goodly beautifull
young woman she was, of delicate language, and singular spirite,
dwelling close by S. <i>Peters</i> gate. This Lady did the Bishop shew to the
Marshall, and when they were come to her, laying his hand uppon her
shoulder, he said. Madam <i>Nonna</i>, What thinke you of this Gallant?
Dare you adventure another wager with him?</p>

<p>Such was the apprehension of this witty Lady, that these words seemed
to taxe her honour, or else to contaminate the hearers understanding,
whereof there were great plenty about her, whose judgement
might be as vile, as the speeches were scandalous. Wherefore, never
seeking for any further purgation of her cleare conscience, but onely to
retort taunt for taunt, presently thus she replied. My Lord, if I should
make such a vile adventure, I would looke to bee payde with better
money.</p>

<p>These words being heard both by the Bishop and Marshall, they felt
themselves touched to the quicke, the one, as the Factor or Broker, for
so dishonest a businesse, to the Brother of the Bishop; and the other, as
receiving (in his owne person) the shame belonging to his Brother. So,
not so much as looking each on other, or speaking one word together
all the rest of that day, they rode away with blushing cheekes. Whereby
we may collect, that the young Lady, being so injuriously provoked,
did no more then well became her, to bite their basenesse neerely, that
so abused her openly.</p>

<h2>The Fourth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Whereby plainly appeareth, that a sodaine witty and merry answer, doth oftentimes
appease the furious choller of an angry man.</i></h4>


<p>Madam <i>Lauretta</i> sitting silent, and the answer of Lady <i>Nonna</i>
having past with generall applause: the Queene commanded
Madame <i>Neiphila</i> to follow next in order; who instantly
thus began. Although a ready wit (faire Ladies)
doth many times affoord worthy and commendable speeches,
according to the accidents happening to the speaker: yet notwithstanding,
Fortune (being a ready helper divers wayes to the timorous)
doth often tippe the tongue with such a present reply, as the partie to
speake, had not so much leysure as to thinke on, nor yet to invent; as I
purpose to let you perceive, by a pretty short Novell.</p>

<p><i>Messer Currado Gianfiliazzi</i> (as most of you have both seene and knowen)
living alwayes in our Citie, in the estate of a Noble Citizen, beeing
a man bountifull, magnificent, and within the degree of Knighthoode:
continually kept both Hawkes and Hounds, taking no meane
delight in such pleasures as they yeelded, neglecting (for them) farre
more serious imployments, wherewith our present subject presumeth
not to meddle. Upon a day, having kilde with his Faulcon a Crane,
neere to a Village called <i>Peretola</i>, and finding her to be both young and
fat, he sent it to his Cooke, a <i>Venetian</i> borne, and named <i>Chichibio</i>, with
command to have it prepared for his supper. <i>Chichibio</i>, who resembled
no other, then (as he was indeede) a plaine, simple, honest merry fellow,
having drest the Crane as it ought to bee, put it on the spit, and laide it
to the fire.</p>

<p>When it was well neere fully roasted, and gave forth a very delicate
pleasing savour; it fortuned that a young Woman dwelling not far off,
named <i>Brunetta</i>, and of whom <i>Chichibio</i> was somewhat enamored, entred
into the Kitchin, and feeling the excellent smell of the Crane, to
please her beyond all savours, that ever she had felt before: she entreated
<i>Chichibio</i> verie earnestly, that hee would bestow a legge thereof on
her. Whereto <i>Chichibio</i> (like a pleasant companion, and evermore delighting
in singing) sung her this answer.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>My</i> Brunetta, <i>faire and feat a,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Why should you say so?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The meate of my Master,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Allowes you for no Taster,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Go from the Kitchin go.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many other speeches past betweene them in a short while, but in the
end, <i>Chichibio</i>, because hee would not have his Mistresse <i>Brunetta</i> angrie
with him; cut away one of the Cranes legges from the spit, and gave it
to her to eate. Afterward, when the Fowle was served up to the Table
before <i>Messer Currado</i>, who had invited certain strangers his friends
to sup with him, wondering not a little, he called for <i>Chichibio</i> his Cook;
demanding what was become of the Cranes other legge? Whereto
the <i>Venetian</i> (being a lyar by Nature) sodainely answered: Sir, Cranes
have no more but one legge each Bird. <i>Messer Currado</i>, growing verie
angry, replyed. Wilt thou tell me, that a Crane hath no more but one
legge? Did I never see a Crane before this? <i>Chichibio</i> persisting resolutely
in his deniall, saide. Beleeve me Sir, I have told you nothing but
the truth, and when you please, I wil make good my wordes, by such
Fowles as are living.</p>

<p>Messer <i>Currado</i>, in kinde love to the strangers that hee had invited to
supper, gave over any further contestation; onely he said. Seeing thou
assurest me, to let me see thy affirmation for truth, by other of the same
Fowles living (a thing which as yet I never saw, or heard of) I am content
to make proofe thereof to morrow morning, till then I shall rest satisfied:
but, upon my word, if I finde it otherwise, expect such a sound
payment, as thy knavery justly deserveth, to make thee remember it all
thy life time. The contention ceassing for the night season, Messer <i>Currado</i>,
who though he had slept well, remained still discontented in his
minde: arose in the morning by breake of day, and puffing &amp; blowing
angerly, called for his horses, commanding <i>Chichibio</i> to mount on one
of them; so riding on towards the River, where (earely every morning)
he had seene plenty of Cranes, he sayde to his man; We shall see anon
Sirra, whether thou or I lyed yesternight.</p>

<p><i>Chichibio</i> perceiving, that his Masters anger was not (as yet) asswaged,
and now it stood him upon, to make good his lye; not knowing how he
should do it, rode after his Master, fearfully trembling all the way. Gladly
he would have made an escape, but hee could not by any possible
meanes, and on every side he looked about him, now before, and after
behinde, to espy any Cranes standing on both their legges, which would
have bin an ominous sight to him. But being come neere to the River,
he chanced to see (before any of the rest) upon the banke thereof, about
a dozen Cranes in number, each of them standing but upon one legge,
as they use to do when they are sleeping. Whereupon, shewing them
quickly to Messer <i>Currado</i>, he said. Now Sir your selfe may see, whether
I told you true yesternight, or no: I am sure a Crane hath but one
thigh, and one leg, as all here present are apparant witnesses, and I have
bin as good as my promise.</p>

<p>Messer <i>Currado</i> looking on the Cranes, and well understanding the
knavery of his man, replyed: Stay but a little while sirra, &amp; I will shew
thee, that a Crane hath two thighes, and two legges. Then riding somwhat
neerer to them, he cryed out aloud, Shough, shough, which caused
them to set downe their other legs, and all fled away, after they had
made a few paces against the winde for their mounting. So going unto
<i>Chichibio</i>, he said: How now you lying Knave, hath a Crane two legs,
or no? <i>Chichibio</i> being well-neere at his wits end, not knowing now
what answer hee should make; but even as it came sodainly into his
minde, said: Sir, I perceive you are in the right, and if you would have
done as much yesternight, and had cryed Shough, as here you did: questionlesse,
the Crane would then have set down the other legge, as these
heere did: but if (as they) she had fled away too, by that meanes you
might have lost your Supper.</p>

<p>This sodaine and unexpected witty answere, comming from such a
logger-headed Lout, and so seasonably for his owne safety: was so pleasing
to <i>Messer Currado</i>, that he fell into a hearty laughter, and forgetting
all anger, saide. <i>Chichibio</i>, thou hast quit thy selfe well, and to my
contentment: albeit I advise thee, to teach mee no more such trickes
heereafter. Thus <i>Chichibio</i>, by his sodaine and merry answer, escaped
a sound beating, which (otherwise) his master had inflicted on him.</p>

divers wayes, to hide under vile
and contemptible Arts, the most
great and unvalewable treasures
of vertue (as, not long since, was
well discoursed unto us by Madam
<i>Pampinea</i>:) so in like manner
hath appeared; that Nature
hath infused very singular spirits
into most misshapen and deformed bodies of men. As hath beene noted
in two of our owne Citizens, of whom I purpose to speake in fewe
words. The one of them was named <i>Messer Forese de Rabatte</i>, a man
of little and low person, but yet deformed in body, with a flat face, like
a Terrier or Beagle, as if no comparison (almost) could bee made more
ugly. But notwithstanding all this deformity, he was so singularly experienced
in the Lawes, that all men held him beyond any equall, or rather
reputed him as a Treasury of civill knowledge.</p>

<p>The other man, being named <i>Giotto</i>, had a spirit of so great excellency,
as there was not any particular thing in Nature, the Mother and
Worke-mistresse of all, by continuall motion of the heavens; but hee
by his pen and pensell could perfectly portrait; shaping them all so truly
alike and resemblable, that they were taken for the reall matters indeede;
and, whether they were present or no, there was hardly any possibility
of their distinguishing. So that many times it happened, that by
the variable devises he made, the visible sence of men became deceived,
in crediting those things to be naturall, which were but meerly painted.
By which meanes, hee reduced that singular Art to light, which long
time before had lyen buried, under the grosse error of some; who, in the
mysterie of painting, delighted more to content the ignorant, then to
please the judicious understanding of the wise, he justly deserving thereby,
to be tearmed one of the <i>Florentines</i> most glorious lights. And so
much the rather, because he performed all his actions, in the true and
lowly spirit of humility: for while he lived, and was a Master in his Art,
above all other Painters: yet he refused any such title, which shined the
more majestically in him, as appeared by such, who knew much lesse
then he, or his Schollers either: yet his knowledge was extreamly coveted
among them.</p>

<p>Now, notwithstanding all this admirable excellency in him: he was
not (thereby) a jot the handsommer man (either in person or countenance)
then was our fore-named Lawyer <i>Messer Forese</i>, and therefore
my Novell concerneth them both. Understand then, (faire Assemblie)
that the possessions and inheritances of <i>Messer Forese</i> and <i>Giotto</i>, lay in
<i>Mugello</i>; wherefore, when Holy-dayes were celebrated by Order of
Court, and in the Sommer time, upon the admittance of so apt a vacation;
<i>Forese</i> rode thither upon a very unsightly Jade, such as a man can
can seldome meet with worse. The like did <i>Giotto</i> the Painter, as ill fitted
every way as the other; and having dispatched their busines there,
they both returned backe towards <i>Florence</i>, neither of them being able
to boast, which was the best mounted.</p>

<p>Riding on a faire and softly pace, because their Horses could goe no
faster: and they being well entred into yeeres, it fortuned (as oftentimes
the like befalleth in Sommer) that a sodaine showre of raine over-tooke
them; for avoyding whereof, they made all possible haste to a poore
Countrey-mans Cottage, familiarly knowne to them both. Having
continued there an indifferent while, and the raine unlikely to cease: to
prevent all further protraction of time, and to arrive at <i>Florence</i> in due
season: they borrowed two old cloakes of the poore man, of over-worn
and ragged Country gray, as also two hoodes of the like Complexion,
(because the poore man had no better) which did more mishape them,
then their owne ugly deformity, and made them notoriously flouted
and scorned, by all that met or overtooke them.</p>

<p>After they had ridden some distance of ground, much moyled and
bemyred with their shuffling Jades, flinging the dirt every way about
them, that well they might be termed two filthy companions: the raine
gave over, and the evening looking somwhat cleare, they began to confer
familiarly together. <i>Messer Forese</i>, riding a lofty <i>French</i> trot, everie
step being ready to hoise him out of his saddle, hearing <i>Giottos</i> discreete
answers to every ydle question he made (for indeede he was a very elegant
speaker) began to peruse and surveigh him, even from the foote to
the head, as we use to say. And perceiving him to be so greatly deformed,
as no man could be worse, in his opinion: without any consideration
of his owne misshaping as bad, or rather more unsightly then hee;
in a scoffing laughing humour, hee saide. <i>Giotto</i>, doest thou imagine,
that a stranger, who had never seene thee before, and should now happen
into our companie, would beleeve thee to bee the best Painter in
the world, as indeede thou art? Presently <i>Giotto</i> (without any further
meditation) returned him this answere. Signior <i>Forese</i>, I think he might
then beleeve it, when (beholding you) hee could imagine that you had
learned your A. B. C. Which when <i>Forese</i> heard, he knew his owne error,
and saw his payment returned in such Coine, as he sold his Wares
for.</p>

Father, and through the procurement of an unlearned Vicare: afterward

<h2>The Sixth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Serving as an advertisement to unlearned Parents, not to bee over-rash, in
censuring on Schollers perfections, through any badde or unbeseeming perswasions.</i></h4>


<p>The Ladies smiled very heartily, at the ready answer of <i>Giotto</i>;
untill the Queene charged Madam <i>Fiammetta</i>, that shee should
next succeed in order: whereupon, thus she began. The verie
greatest infelicity that can happen to a man, and most insupportable of
all other, is Ignorance; a word (I say) which hath bin so generall, as under
it is comprehended all imperfections whatsoever. Yet notwithstanding,
whosoever can cull (graine by graine) the defects incident to humane
race; will and must confesse, that wee are not all borne to knowledge:
but onely such, whom the heavens illuminating by their bright radiance
(wherein consisteth the sourse and well-spring of all science) by little &amp;
little, do bestow the influence of their bounty, on such and so manie as
they please, who are to expresse themselves the more thankfull for such
a blessing. And although this grace doth lessen the misfortune of many,
which were over-mighty to bee in all; yet some there are, who by
sawcie presuming on themselves, doe bewray their ignorance by theyr
owne speeches; setting such behaviour on each matter, and soothing every
thing with such gravity, even as if they would make comparison:
or (to speake more properly) durst encounter in the Listes with great
<i>Salomon</i> or <i>Socrates</i>. But let us leave them, and come to the matter of
our purposed Novell.</p>

<p>In a certaine Village of <i>Piccardie</i>, there lived a Priest or Vicar, who
beeing meerely an ignorant blocke, had yet such a peremptorie presuming
spirite: as, though it was sufficiently discerned, yet hee beguiled
many thereby, untill at last he deceyved himselfe, and with due chastisement
to his folly.</p>

<p>A plaine Husbandman dwelling in the same Village, possessed of
much Land and Living, but verie grosse and dull in understanding; by
the entreaty of divers his Friends and Well-willers, some-thing more
intelligable then himselfe: became incited, or rather provoked, to send a
Sonne of his to the University of <i>Paris</i>, to study there as was fitting for a
Scholler. To the end (quoth they) that having but this Son onely, and
Fortunes blessings abounding in store for him: hee might like wise have
the riches of the minde, which are those true treasures indeede, that <i>Aristippus</i>
giveth us advice to be furnished withall.</p>

<p>His Friends perswasions having prevailed, and hee continued at <i>Paris</i>
for the space of three yeares: what with the documents he had attayned
to, before his going thither, and by meanes of a happie memory in the
time of his being there, wherewith no young man was more singularly
endued (in so short a while) he attained and performed the greater part
of his Studies.</p>

<p>Now, as oftentimes it commeth to passe, the love of a Father (surmounting
all other affections in man) made the olde Farmer desirous to
see his Sonne: which caused his sending for him with all convenient
speede, and obedience urged his as forward willingnesse thereto. The
good olde man, not a little joyfull to see him in so good condition and
health, and encreased so much in stature since his parting thence: familiarly
told him, that he earnestly desired to know, if his minde and body
had attained to a competent and equall growth, which within three or
foure dayes he would put in practise.</p>

<p>No other helpe had he silly simple man, but Master Vicar must bee
the questioner and poser of his son: wherein the Priest was very unwilling
to meddle, for feare of discovering his owne ignorance, which passed
under better opinion then he deserved. But the Farmer beeing importunate,
and the Vicar many wayes beholding to him, durst not returne
deniall, but undertooke it very formally, as if he had bene an able
man indeede.</p>

<p>But see how Fooles are borne to be fortunate, and where they least
hope, there they find the best successe; the simplicitie of the Father, must
be the meanes for abusing his Schollerly Son, and a skreene to stand betweene
the Priest and his ignorance. Earnest is the olde man to know,
what and how farre his Sonne had profited at Schoole, and by what
note he might best take understanding of his answeres: which jumping
fit with the Vicars vanity, and a warrantable cloake to cover his knavery;
he appoints him but one word onely, namely <i>Nescio</i>, wherewith
if he answered to any of his demands, it was an evident token, that hee
understood nothing. As thus they were walking and conferring in the
Church, the Farmer very carefull to remember the word <i>Nescio</i>: it came
to passe upon a sodaine, that the young man entred into them, to the
great contentment of his Father, who prayed Master Vicar, to make approbation
of his Sonne, whether he were learned, or no, and how hee
had benefited at the University?</p>

<p>After the time of the daies salutations had past betweene them, the
Vicar being subtle and crafty, as they walked along by one of the tombs
in the Church; pointing with his finger to the Tombe, the Priest uttered
these words to the Scholler.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Quis hic est sepultus?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The young Scholler (by reason it was erected since his departure, and
finding no inscription whereby to informe him) answered, as well hee
might, <i>Nescio</i>. Immediately the Father, keeping the word perfectly
in his memorie, grewe verie angerly passionate; and, desiring to
heare no more demaunds: gave him three or foure boxes on the eares;
with many harsh and injurious speeches, tearming him an Asse and Villaine,
and that he had not learned any thing. His Sonne was pacient,
and returned no answer, but plainly perceived, that this was a tricke intended
against him, by the malicious treachery of the Priest, on whom
(in time) he might be revenged.</p>

<p>Within a short while after, the Suffragane of those parts (under whom
the Priest was but a Deputy, holding the benefice of him, with no great
charge to his conscience) being abroad in his visitation, sent word to the
Vicar, that he intended to preach there on the next Sunday, and hee to
prepare in a readinesse, <i>Bonum &amp; Commodum</i>, because hee would have
nothing else to his dinner. Heereat Master Vicar was greatly amazed,
because he had never heard such words before, neither could hee finde
them in all his <i>Breviarie</i>. Hereupon, he went to the young scholler, whom
he had so lately before abused, and crying him mercy, with many impudent
and shallow excuses, desired him to reveale the meaning of those
words, and what he should understand by <i>Bonum &amp; Commodum</i>.</p>

<p>The Scholler (with a sober and modest countenance) made answere;
That he had bin over-much abused, which (neverthelesse) he tooke not
so impaciently, but hee had already both forgot and forgiven it, with
promise of comfort in this his extraordinary distraction, and greefe of
minde. When he had perused the Suffraganes Letter, well observing
the blushlesse ignorance of the Priest: seeming (by outward appearance)
to take it strangely, he cryed out alowd, saying; In the name of Vertue,
what may be this mans meaning? How? (quoth the Priest) What manner
of demand do you make? Alas, replyed the Scholler, you have but
one poore Asse, which I know you love deerely, and yet you must stew
his genitories very daintily, for your Patron will have no other meat to
his dinner. The genitories of mine Asse, answered the Priest? Passion
of me, who then shall carrie my Corne to the Mill? There is no remedie,
sayde the Scholler, for he hath so set it downe for an absolute resolution.</p>

<p>After that the Priest had considered thereon a while by himselfe, remembring
the yearely revennewes, which clearely hee put up into his
purse, to be ten times of farre greater worth then his Asse: he concluded
to have him gelded, what danger soever should ensue thereon, preparing
them in readinesse against his comming. So soone as the Suffragan
was there arrived, heavily hee complained to him for his Asse: which
kinde of Language he not understanding, knew not what he meant, nor
how he should answer. But beeing (by the Scholler) acquainted with
the whole History, he laughed heartily at the Priests ignorant folly, wishing
that all such bold Bayards (from time to time) might be so served.
Likewise, that all ignorant Priests, Vicars, and other Grashoppers of
Townes or Villages, who sometimes have onely seene <i>Partes orationis
quod sunt</i>, not to stand over-much on their owne sufficiency, grounded
soly upon their Grammar; but to beware whom they jest withall, without
meddling with Schollers, who take not injuries as dullards doe, least
they prove infamous by their disputations.</p>

<i>because he tooke her in Adulterie, with a young Gentleman named</i> Lazarino
de Guazzagliotori: <i>caused her to bee cited before the Judge. From
whom she delivered her selfe, by a sodaine, witty and pleasant answer, and
moderated a severe strict Statute, formerly made against women.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Seventh Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is declared, of what worth it is to confesse a trueth, with a facetious
and witty excuse.</i></h4>


<p>After that Madame <i>Fiammetta</i> had given over speaking, and all
the Auditory had sufficiently applauded the Schollers honest
revenge, the Queene enjoyned <i>Philostratus</i>, to proceede on
next with his Novell, which caused him to begin thus. Beleeve
me Ladies, it is an excellent &amp; most commendable thing, to speak
well, and to all purposes: but I hold it a matter of much greater worth,
to know how to do it, and when necessity doth most require it. Which
a Gentlewoman (of whom I am now to speake) was so well enstructed
in, as not onely it yeelded the hearers mirthfull contentment, but likewise
delivered her from the danger of death, as (in few words) you shall
heare related.</p>

<p>In the Citie of <i>Prato</i>, there was an Edict or Statute, no lesse blameworthy
(to speake uprightly) then most severe and cruell, which (without
making any distinction) gave strict command; That everie Woman
should be burned with fire, whose husband found her in the acte of Adultery,
with any secret or familiar friend, as one deserving to bee thus
abandoned, like such as prostituted their bodies to publike sale or hire.
During the continuance of this sharpe Edict, it fortuned that a Gentlewoman,
who was named <i>Phillippa</i>, was found in her Chamber one
night, in the armes of a young Gentleman of the same City, named <i>Lazarino
de Guazzagliotori</i>, and by her owne husband, called <i>Rinaldo de
Pugliese</i>, shee loving the young Gallant, as her owne life, because hee
was most compleate in all perfections, and every way as deerely addicted
to her.</p>

<p>This sight was so irkesome to <i>Rinaldo</i>, that, being overcom with extreame
rage, hee could hardly containe from running on them, with a
violent intent to kill them both: but feare of his owne life caused his
forbearance, meaning to be revenged by some better way. Such was
the heate of his spleene and fury, as, setting aside all respect of his owne
shame: he would needs prosecute the rigour of the deadly Edict, which
he held lawfull for him to do, although it extended to the death of his
Wife. Heereupon, having witnesses sufficient, to approve the guiltinesse
of her offence: a day being appointed (without desiring any other
counsell) he went in person to accuse her, and required justice against
her.</p>

<p>The Gentlewoman, who was of an high and undauntable spirite, as
all such are, who have fixed their affection resolvedly, and love uppon a
grounded deliberation: concluded, quite against the counsell and opinion
of her Parents, Kindred, and Friends; to appeare in the Court, as
desiring rather to dye, by confessing the trueth with a manly courage,
then by denying it, and her love unto so worthy a person as he was, in
whole arms she chanced to be taken; to live basely in exile with shame,
as an eternall scandall to her race. So, before the Potestate, shee made
her apparance, worthily accompanied both with men and women, all
advising her to deny the acte: but she, not minding them or their perswasions,
looking on the Judge with a constant countenance, and a
voyce of setled resolve, craved to know of him, what hee demaunded
of her?</p>

<p>The Potestate well noting her brave carriage, her singular beautie
and praise-worthy parts, her words apparantly witnessing the heighth
of her minde: beganne to take compassion on her, and doubted, least
shee would confesse some such matter, as should enforce him to pronounce
the sentence of death against her. But she boldly scorning all
delayes, or any further protraction of time; demanded again, what was
her accusation? Madame, answered the Potestate, I am sory to tel you,
what needs I must, your husband (whom you see present heere) is the
complainant against you, avouching, that he tooke you in the act of adultery
with another man: and therefore he requireth, that, according to
the rigour of the Statute heere in force with us, I should pronounce
sentence against you, and (consequently) the infliction of death. Which
I cannot do, if you confesse not the fact, and therefore be well advised,
how you answer me, and tell me the truth, if it be as your Husband accuseth
you, or no.</p>

<p>The Lady, without any dismay or dread at all, pleasantly thus replied.
My Lord, true it is, that <i>Rinaldo</i> is my Husband, and that he found
me, on the night named, betweene the Armes of <i>Lazarino</i>, where many
times heeretofore he hath embraced mee, according to the mutuall
love re-plighted together, which I deny not, nor ever will. But you
know well enough, and I am certaine of it, that the Lawes enacted in any
Countrey, ought to be common, and made with consent of them
whom they concerne, which in this Edict of yours is quite contrarie.
For it is rigorous against none, but poore women onely, who are able
to yeeld much better content and satisfaction generally, then remaineth
in the power of men to do. And moreover, when this Law was made,
there was not any woman that gave consent to it, neither were they called
to like or allow thereof: in which respect, it may deservedly be termed,
an unjust Law. And if you will, in prejudice of my bodie, and of
your owne soule, be the executioner of so unlawfull an Edict, it consisteth
in your power to do as you please.</p>

<p>But before you proceede to pronounce any sentence, may it please
you to favour me with one small request, namely, that you would demand
of my Husband, if at all times, and whensoever he tooke delight
in my company, I ever made any curiosity, or came to him unwillingly.
Whereto <i>Rinaldo</i>, without tarrying for the Potestate to moove the
question, sodainly answered; that (undoubtedly) his wife at all times,
and oftner then he could request it, was never sparing of her kindnesse,
or put him off with any deniall. Then the Lady, continuing on her
former speeches, thus replyed. Let me then demand of you my Lord,
being our Potestate and Judge, if it be so, by my Husbands owne free
confession, that he hath alwaies had his pleasure of me, without the least
refusall in me, or contradiction; what should I doe with the over-plus
remaining in mine owne power, and whereof he had no need? Would
you have mee cast it away to the Dogges? Was it not more fitting for
me, to pleasure therewith a worthy Gentleman, who was even at deaths
doore for my love, then (my husbands surfetting, and having no neede
of me) to let him lye languishing, and dye?</p>

<p>Never was heard such an examination before, and to come from a
woman of such worth, the most part of the honourable <i>Pratosians</i> (both
Lords and Ladies) being there present, who hearing her urge such a necessary
question, cryed out all aloud together with one voice (after they
had laughed their fill) that the Lady had saide well, and no more then
she might. So that, before they departed thence, by comfortable advice
proceeding from the Potestate: the Edict (being reputed overcruell)
was modified, and interpreted to concerne them onely, who offered
injurie to their Husbands for money. By which meanes, <i>Rinaldo</i>
standing as one confounded, for such a foolish and unadvised enterprize,
departed from the Auditorie: and the Ladie, not a little joyfull to bee
thus freed and delivered from the fire, returned home with victorie to
her owne house.</p>

<h2>The Eighth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>In just scorne of such unsightly and ill-pleasing surly Sluts, who imagine none
to be faire or well-favoured, but themselves.</i></h4>


<p>All the while as <i>Philostratus</i> was re-counting his Novell;
it seemed, that the Ladies (who heard it) found themselves
much mooved thereat, as by the wanton blood monting
up into their cheekes, it plainly appeared. But in the end,
looking on each other with strange behaviour, they could
not forbeare smiling: which the Queene interrupting by a command of
attention, turning to Madame <i>Æmillia</i>, willed her to follow next. When
she, puffing and blowing, as if she had bene newly awaked from sleepe,
began in this manner.</p>

<p>Faire Beauties; My thoughts having wandred a great distance hence,
and further then I can easily collect them together againe; in obedience
yet to our Queene, I shall report a much shorter Novell, then otherwise
(perhappes) I should have done, if my minde had beene a little neerer
home. I shall tell you the grosse fault of a foolish Damosell, well corrected
by a witty reprehension of her Uncle; if shee had bin endued but
with so much sence, as to have understood it.</p>

<p>An honest man, named <i>Fresco da Celatico</i>, had a good fulsome wench to
his Neece, who for her folly and squemishnes, was generally called <i>Cesca</i>,
or nice <i>Francesca</i>. And although she had stature sufficient, yet none of
the handsomest, &amp; a good hard favourd countenance, nothing nere such
Angelical beauties as we have seen: yet she was endued with such height
of minde, and so proud an opinion of her selfe, that it appeared as a custome
bred in hir, or rather a gift bestowed on hir by nature (though none
of the best) to blame and despise both men and women, yea whosoever
she lookt on; without any consideration of her self, she being as unsightly,
ill shaped, and ugly faced, as a worse was very hardly to be found.</p>

<p>Nothing could be done at any time, to yeilde her liking or content:
moreover, she was so waspish, nice, &amp; squemish, that when she came into
the royall Court of <i>France</i>, it was hatefull &amp; contemptible to hir. Whensoever
she went through the streets, every thing stunke and was noisome
to her; so that she never did any thing but stop her nose; as if all men or
women she met withall; and whatsoever else she lookt on, were stinking
and offensive. But let us leave all further relation of her ill conditions,
being every way (indeed) so bad, and hardly becomming any sensible
body, that we cannot condemne them so much as we should.</p>

<p>It chanced upon a day, that shee comming home to the house where
her Uncle dwelt, declared her wonted scurvy and scornfull behaviour;
swelling, puffing, and pouting extreamly, in which humor she sat downe
by her Uncle, who desiring to know what had displeased her, said. Why
how now <i>Francesca</i>? what may the meaning of this bee? This being a solemne
festivall day, what is the reason of your so soone returning home?
She coily biting the lip, and brideling her head, as if she had bene some
mans best Gelding, sprucely thus replyed.</p>

<p>Indeede you say true Uncle, I am come home verie earely, because,
since the day of my birth, I never saw a City so pestered with unhandsome
people, both men and women, and worse this high Holyday then
ever I did observe before. I walked thorow some store of streetes, and I
could not see one proper man: and as for the women, they are the most
misshapen and ugly creatures, that, if God had made me such an one, I
should be sory that ever I was borne. And being no longer able to endure
such unpleasing sights; you wil not thinke (Uncle) in what an anger
I am come home. <i>Fresco</i>, to whome these stinking qualities of his
Neece seemed so unsufferable, that hee could not (with patience) endure
them any longer, thus short and quickely answered. <i>Francesca</i>, if
all people of our Citie (both men and women) be so odious in thy eyes,
and offensive to thy nose, as thou hast often reported to me: bee advised
then by my counsell. Stay stil at home, and look upon none but thy selfe
onely, and then thou shalt be sure that they cannot displease thee. But
she, being as empty of wit as a pith-lesse Cane, and yet thought her
judgement to exceed <i>Salomons</i>, could not understand the lest part of hir
Uncles meaning, but stood as senselesse as a sheepe. Onely she replyed,
that she would resort to some other parts of the country, which if shee
found as weakly furnished of handsome people, as heere shee did, shee
would conceive better of her selfe, then ever she had done before.</p>

<h2>The Ninth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Notably discovering the great difference that is betweene learning and ignorance,
upon judicious apprehension.</i></h4>


<p>When the Queene perceived, that Madame <i>Æmillia</i> was discharged
of her Novell, and none remained now to speake next, but
onely her selfe, his priviledge alwayes remembred, to whom it
belonged to be the last, she began in this manner.</p>

<p>Faire Company, you have this day disappointed me of two Novells
at the least, whereof I had intended to make use. Neverthelesse, you
shall not imagine mee so unfurnished, but that I have left one in store;
the conclusion whereof, may minister such instruction, as will not bee
reputed for ydle and impertinent: but rather of such materiall consequence,
as better hath not this day past among us.</p>

<p>Understand then (most faire Ladies) that in former times long since
past, our Cittie had many excellent and commendable customes in it;
whereof (in these unhappy dayes of ours) we cannot say that poore
one remaineth, such hath beene the too much encrease of Wealth and
Covetousnesse, the onely supplanters of all good qualities whatsoever.
Among which lawdable and friendly observations, there was one well
deserving note, namely, that in divers places of <i>Florence</i>, men of the best
houses in every quarter, had a sociable and neighbourly assemblie together,
creating their company to consist of a certaine number, such as
were able to supply their expences as this day one, and to morrow another:
and thus in a kinde of friendly course, each daily furnished the
Table, for the rest of the company. Oftentimes, they did honour to divers
Gentlemen and strangers, upon their arrivall in our City, by inviting
them into their assembly, and many of our worthiest Citizens beside;
so that it grew to a customary use, and one especially day in the
yeare appointed, in memory of this so loving a meeting, when they
would ride (triumphally as it were) on horsebacke thorow the Cittie,
sometimes performing Tilts, Tourneyes, and other Martiall exercises,
but they were reserved for Feastivall dayes.</p>

<p>Among which company, there was one called, <i>Signior Betto Bruneleschi</i>,
who was earnestly desirous, to procure <i>Signior Guido Cavalcante
de Cavalcanti</i>, to make one in this their friendly society. And not without
great reason: for, over and beside his being one of the best Logitians
as those times could not yeeld a better: He was also a most absolute naturall
Philosopher (which worthy qualities were little esteemed among
these honest meeters) a very friendly Gentleman, singularly well spoken,
and whatsoever else was commendable in any man, was no way
wanting in him, being wealthy withall, and able to returne equall honours,
where he found them to be duly deserved, as no man therein could
go beyond him. But <i>Signior Betto</i>, notwithstanding his long continued
importunitie, could not draw him into their assembly, which made him
and the rest of his company conceive, that the solitude of <i>Guido</i>, retiring
himselfe alwaies from familiar conversing with men: provoked him to
many curious speculations: and because he retained some part of the
<i>Epicurean</i> Opinion, their vulgare judgement passed on him, that his
speculations tended to no other end, but onely to finde out that which
was never done.</p>

<p>It chanced upon a day, that <i>Signior Guido</i> departing from the Church
of Saint <i>Michaell d'Horta</i>, and passing along by the <i>Adamari</i>, so farre as
to Saint <i>Johns</i> Church, which evermore was his customarie Walke: many
goodly Marble Tombes were then about the saide Church, as now
adayes are at Saint <i>Reparata</i>, and divers more beside. He entring among
the Collumbes of Porphiry, and the other Sepulchers being there, because
the doore of the Church was shut: <i>Signior Betto</i> &amp; his companie,
came riding from S. <i>Reparata</i>, &amp; espying <i>Signior Guido</i> among the graves
and tombes, said. Come, let us go make some jests to anger him. So putting
the spurs to their horses, they rode apace towards him: and being
upon him before he perceived them, one of them said. <i>Guido</i> thou refusest
to be one of our society, &amp; seekest for that which never was: when
thou hast found it, tell us, what wilt thou do with it?</p>

<p><i>Guido</i> seeing himselfe round engirt with them, sodainly thus replyed:
Gentlemen, you may use mee in your owne house as you please.
And setting his hand on one of the Tombes (which was some-what
great) he tooke his rising, and leapt quite over it on the further side, as
being of an agile and sprightly body, and being thus freed from them,
he went away to his owne lodging. They stoode all like men amazed,
strangely looking one upon another, and began afterward to murmure
among themselves: That <i>Guido</i> was a man without any understanding,
and the answer which he had made unto them, was to no purpose, neither
savoured of any discretion, but meerely came from an empty brain
because they had no more to do in the place where now they were, then
any of the other Citizens, and Signior <i>Guido</i> (himselfe) as little as any
of them; whereto Signior <i>Betto</i> thus replyed.</p>

<p>Alas Gentlemen, it is you your selves that are void of understanding:
for, if you had but observed the answer which he made unto us: hee did
honestly, and (in verie few words) not onely notably expresse his owne
wisedome, but also deservedly reprehend us. Because, if wee observe
things as we ought to doe, Graves and Tombes are the houses of the
dead, ordained and prepared to be their latest dwellings. He tolde us
moreover, that although we have heere (in this life) other habitations
and abidings; yet these (or the like) must at last be our houses. To let
us know, and all other foolish, indiscreete, and unlearned men, that we
are worse then dead men, in comparison of him, and other men equall
to him in skill and learning. And therefore, while wee are heere among
these Graves and Monuments, it may well be said, that we are not farre
from our owne houses, or how soone we shall be possessors of them, in
regard of the frailty attending on us.</p>

<p>Then every one could presently say, that Signior <i>Guido</i> had spoken
nothing but the truth, and were much ashamed of their owne folly, and
shallow estimation which they had made of <i>Guido</i>, desiring never more
after to meddle with him so grossely, and thanking Signior <i>Betto</i>, for so
well reforming their ignorance, by his much better apprehension.</p>

<h2>The Tenth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein may be observed, what palpable abuses do many times passe, under
the counterfeit Cloake of Religion.</i></h4>


<p>When all of them had delivered their Novels, <i>Dioneus</i> knowing
that it remained in him to relate the last for this
day: without attending for any solemne command (after
he had imposed silence on them, that could not sufficiently
commend the witty reprehension of <i>Guido</i>) thus he
began. Wise and worthy Ladies, although by the priviledge you have
granted, it is lawfull for me to speake any thing best pleasing to my self:
yet notwithstanding, it is not any part of my meaning, to varrie from
the matter and method, whereof you have spoken to very good purpose.
And therefore, following your footsteppes, I entend to tell you,
how craftily, and with a Rampiar sodainly raised in his owne defence:
a Religious Frier of Saint <i>Anthonies</i> Order, shunned a shame, which
two wily companions had prepared for him. Nor let it offend you, if I
run into more large discourse, then this day hath bene used by any, for
the apter compleating of my Novell: because, if you well observe it, the
Sun is as yet in the middest of heaven, and therefore you may the better
forbeare me.</p>

<p><i>Certoldo</i>, as (perhaps) you know, or have heard, is a Village in the
Vale of <i>Elsa</i>, and under the authority and commaund of our <i>Florence</i>,
which although it be but small: yet (in former times) it hath bin inhabited
with Gentlemen, and people of especiall respect. A religious Friar
of S. <i>Anthonies</i> Order, named Friar <i>Onyon</i>, had long time used to resort
thither, to receive the benevolent almes, which those charitably affected
people in simplicity gave him, &amp; chiefly at divers daies of the year, when
their bounty and devotion would extend themselves more largely then
at other seasons. And so much the rather, because they thought him to
be a good Pastor of holy life in outward appearance, &amp; carried a name
of much greater matter, then remained in the man indeed; beside, that
part of the country yeilded far more plentifull abundance of Onyons,
then all other in <i>Tuscany</i> elsewhere, a kinde of foode greatly affected by
those Friars, as men alwaies of hungry &amp; good appetite. This Friar <i>Onyon</i>
was a man of little stature, red haire, a chearfull countenance, and
the world afforded not a more crafty companion, then he. Moreover,
albeit he had very little knowledge or learning, yet he was so prompt,
ready &amp; voluble of speech, uttering often he knew not what himselfe:
that such as were not wel acquainted with his qualities, supposed him
to be a singular Rhetoritian, excelling <i>Cicero</i> or <i>Quintilian</i> themselves;
&amp; he was a gossip, friend, or deerely affected, by every one dwelling in
those parts. According to his wonted custome, one time he went thither
in the month of August, and on a Sunday morning, when all the dwellers
thereabout, were present to heare Masse, and in the chiefest Church
above all the rest: when the Friar saw time convenient for his purpose,
he advanced himselfe, and began to speake in this manner.</p>

<p>Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, you know you have kept a commendable
custom, in sending yeerly to the poore brethren of our Lord Baron
S. <i>Anthony</i>, both of your Corne and other provision, some more,
some lesse, all according to their power, means, and devotion, to the end
that blessed S. <i>Anthony</i> should be the more carefull of your oxen, sheep,
asses, swine, pigs, and other cattle. Moreover, you have used to pay (especially
such as have their names registred in our Fraternity) those duties
which annually you send unto us. For the collection whereof, I am sent
by my Superior, namely our L. Abbot, &amp; therfore (with Gods blessing)
you may come after noone hither, when you shal heare the Bels of the
Church ring: then will I make a predication to you; you shall kisse the
Crosse, and beside, because I know you al to be most devout servants to
our Lord Baron S. <i>Anthony</i>, in especiall grace and favor, I wil shew you
a most holy and goodly Relique, which I my selfe (long since) brought
from the holy Land beyond the seas. If you desire to know what it is,
let me tell you, that it is one of the Feathers of the same <i>Phoenix</i>, which
was in the Arke with the Patriarch <i>Noah</i>. And having thus spoken, he
became silent, returning backe to heare Masse. While hee delivered
these and the like speeches, among the other people then in the church,
there were two shrewde and crafty Companions; the one, named
<i>John de Bragoniero</i>, and the other, <i>Biagio Pizzino</i>. These subtile Fellowes,
after they had heard the report of Fryer <i>Onyons</i> Relique: although
they were his intimate friends, and came thither in his company; yet
they concluded betweene themselves, to shew him a tricke of Legierdumaine,
and to steale the Feather from him. When they had intelligence
of Friar <i>Onyons</i> dining that day at the Castle, with a worthy Friend of
his: no sooner was he set at the Table, but away went they in all haste,
to the Inne where the Fryar frequented, with this determination, that
<i>Biagio</i> should hold conference with the Friars boy, while his fellow ransackt
the Wallet, to finde the Feather, and carry it away with him, for
a future observation, what the Friar would say unto the people, when
he found the losse of the Feather, and could not performe his promise
to them.</p>

<p>The Fryars Boy, whom some called <i>Guccio Balena</i>, some <i>Guccio Imbrata</i>,
and others <i>Guccio Porco</i>, was such a knavish Lad, and had so many
bad qualities, as <i>Lippo Topo</i> the cunning Painter, or the most curious
Poeticall wit, had not any ability to describe them. Friar <i>Onyon</i> himself
did often observe his behaviour, and would make this report among his
Friends. My Boy (quoth he) hath nine rare qualities in him, and such
they are, as if <i>Salomon, Aristotle,</i> or <i>Seneca</i> had onely but one of them: it
were sufficient to torment and trouble all their vertue, all their senses, &amp;
all their sanctity. Consider then, what manner of man he is like to be,
having nine such rarities, yet voide of all vertue, wit, or goodnes. And
when it was demaunded of Friar <i>Onyon</i>, what these nine rare conditions
were: hee having them all readie by heart, and in rime, thus answered:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Boyes I have knowne, and seene,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i9"><i>And heard of many:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i20">But,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For Lying, Loytring, Lazinesse,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For Facing, Filching, Filthinesse;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For Carelesse, Gracelesse, all Unthriftinesse,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i9"><i>My Boy excelleth any.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, over and beside all these admirable qualities, hee hath manie
more such singularities, which (in favour towards him) I am faine to conceale.
But that which I smile most at in him, is that he would have a
Wife in every place where he commeth, yea, and a good house to boot
too: for, in regard his beard beginneth to shew it selfe, rising thicke in
haire, blacke and amiable, he is verily perswaded, that all Women will
fall in love with him; and if they refuse to follow him, he will in all hast
run after them. But truly, he is a notable servant to mee, for I cannot
speake with any one, and in never so great secrecy, but he will be sure to
heare his part; and when any question is demanded of me, he standes in
such awe and feare of my displeasure: that he will bee sure to make the
first answer, yea or no, according as he thinketh most convenient.</p>

<p>Now, to proceede where we left, Friar <i>Onyon</i> having left this serviceable
youth at his lodging, to see that no bodie should meddle with his
commodities, especially his Wallet, because of the sacred things therein
contained: <i>Guccio Imbrata</i>, who as earnestly affected to be in the Kitchin,
as Birds to hop from branch to branch, especially, when anie of
the Chamber-maides were there, espyed one of the Hostesses Female
attendants, a grosse fat Trugge, low of stature, ill faced, and worse formed,
with a paire of brests like two bumbards, smelling loathsomely of
grease and sweate; downe shee descended into the Kitchin, like a Kite
upon a peece of Carion. This Boy, or Knave, chuse whither you will
style him, having carelesly left Fryar <i>Onyons</i> Chamber doore open, and
all the holy things so much to be neglected, although it was then the
moneth of August, when heate is in the highest predominance, yet hee
would needs sit downe by the fire, and began to conferre with this amiable
creature, who was called by the name of <i>Nuta</i>.</p>

<p>Being set close by her, he told her, that he was a Gentleman by Atturniship,
and that he had more millions of Crownes, then all his life time
would serve him to spend; beside those which he payed away dayly, as
having no convenient imployment for them. Moreover, he knew how
to speake, and do such things, as were beyond wonder or admiration.
And, never remembring his olde tatterd Friars Cowle, which was so
snottie and greazie, that good store of kitchin stuffe might have beene
boiled out of it; as also a foule slovenly Trusse or halfedoublet, all baudied
with bowsing, fat greazie lubberly sweating, and other drudgeries
in the Convent Kitchin, where he was an Officer in the meanest credite.
So that to describe this sweet youth in his lively colours, both for naturall
perfections of body, and artificiall composure of his Garments; never
came the fowlest silks out of <i>Tartaria</i> or <i>India</i>, more ugly or unsightly
to bee lookt upon. And for a further addition to his neate knavery,
his breeches were so rent betweene his legges, his shooes and stockings
had bin at such a mercilesse massacre: that the gallantest <i>Commandador</i>
of <i>Castile</i> (though he had never so lately bin releast out of slavery) could
have wisht for better garments, then he; or make larger promises, then
he did to his <i>Nuta</i>. Protesting to entitle her as his onely, to free her
from the Inne and Chamber thraldomes, if she would live with him, be
his Love, partaker of his present possessions, and so to succeed in his future
Fortunes. All which bravadoes, though they were belcht foorth
with admirable insinuations: yet they converted into smoke, as all such
braggadochio behaviours do, and he was as wise at the ending, as when
he began.</p>

<p>Our former named two craftie Companions, seeing <i>Guccio Porco</i> so
seriously employed about <i>Nuta</i>, was there-with not a little contented,
because their intended labour was now more then halfe ended. And
perceiving no contradiction to crosse their proceeding, into Friar <i>Onyons</i>
chamber entred they, finding it ready open for their purpose: where
the first thing that came into their hand in search, was the wallet. When
they had opened it, they found a small Cabinet, wrapped in a great many
foldings of rich Taffata; and having unfolded it, a fine formall Key
was hanging thereat: wherewith having unlockt the Cabinet, they found
a faire Feather of a Parrots taile, which they supposed to bee the verie
same, that he meant to shew the people of <i>Certaldo</i>. And truly (in those
dayes) it was no hard matter to make them beleeve anything, because
the idle vanities of <i>Ægypt</i> and those remoter parts, had not (as yet) bin
seene in <i>Tuscany</i>, as since then they have bin in great abundance, to the
utter ruine (almost) of <i>Italy</i>.</p>

<p>And although they might then be knowne to very few, yet the inhabitants
of the Country generally, understoode little or nothing at all of
them. For there, the pure simplicitie of their ancient predecessours still
continuing; they had not seene any Parrots, or so much as heard any
speech of them. Wherefore the two crafty consorts, not a little joyfull
of finding the Feather, tooke it thence with them, and beecause they
would not leave the Cabinet empty, espying Char-coales lying in a corner
of the Chamber, they filled it with them, wrapping it up againe in
the Taffata, and in as demure manner as they found it. So, away came
they with the Feather, neither seene or suspected by any one, intending
now to heare what Friar <i>Onyon</i> would say, uppon the losse of his precious
Relique, and finding the Coales there placed insted thereof.</p>

<p>The simple men and women of the country, who had bin at morning
Masse in the Church, and heard what a wonderful Feather they should
see in the after noone; returned in all hast to their houses, where one telling
this newes to another, and gossip with gossip consulting thereon; they
made the shorter dinner, and afterward flocked in maine troopes to the
Castle, contending who shold first get entrance, such was their devotion
to see the holy feather. Friar <i>Onyon</i> having dined, and reposed a little after
his wine, he arose from the table to the window, where beholding what
multitudes came to see the feather, he assured himselfe of good store of
mony. Hereupon, he sent to his Boy <i>Guccio Imbrata</i>, that uppon the Bels
ringing, he should come and bring the wallet to him. Which (with much
ado) he did, so soone as his quarrell was ended in the kitchin, with the amiable
Chamber-maid <i>Nuta</i>, away then he went with his holy commodities:
where he was no sooner arrived, but because his belly was readie
to burst with drinking water, he sent him to the Church to ring the bels,
which not onely would warme the cold water in his belly, but likewise
make him run as gaunt as a Grey-hound.</p>

<p>When all the people were assembled in the Church together, Friar
<i>Onyon</i> (never distrusting any injurie offered him, or that his close commodities
had bin meddled withall) began his predication, uttering a thousand
lies to fit his purpose. And when he came to shew the feather of the
Phoenix (having first in great devotion finisht the confession) he caused
two goodly torches to be lighted, &amp; ducking downe his head three severall
times, before hee would so much as touch the Taffata, he opened it
with much reverence. So soone as the Cabinet came to be seen, off went
his Hood, lowly he bowed downe his body, and uttering especiall praises
of the Phoenix, and sacred properties of the wonderfull Relique, the
Cover of the Cabinet being lifted uppe, he saw the same to bee full of
Coales. He could not suspect his Villaine boy to do this deede, for he
knew him not to be endued with so much wit, onely hee curst him for
keeping it no better, and curst himselfe also, for reposing trust in such a
careles knave, knowing him to be slothfull, disobedient, negligent, and
void of all honest understanding or grace. Sodainly (without blushing)
lest his losse should be discerned, he lifted his lookes and hands to heaven,
speaking out so loude, as every one might easily heare him, thus:
O thou omnipotent providence, for ever let thy power be praised. Then
making fast the Cabinet againe, and turning himselfe to the people, with
lookes expressing admiration, he proceeded in this manner.</p>

<p>Lords, Ladies, and you the rest of my worthy Auditors: You are to
understand, that I (being then very young) was sent by my Superiour,
into those parts, where the Sun appeareth at his first rising. And I had
received charge by expresse command, that I should seeke for (so much
as consisted in my power to do) the especiall vertues and priviledges belonging
to Porcellane, which although the boyling thereof bee worth
but little, yet it is very profitable to any but us. In regard whereof, being
upon my journey, and departing from <i>Venice</i>, passing along the <i>Borgo
de Grecia</i>, I proceeded thence (on horseback) through the Realme of
<i>Garbo</i>, so to <i>Baldacca</i>, till I came to <i>Parione</i>; from whence, not without
great extremity of thirst, I arrived in <i>Sardignia</i>.</p>

<p>But why do I trouble you with the repetition of so many countries?
I coasted on still, after I had past Saint <i>Georges Arme</i>, into <i>Trussia</i>, and
then into <i>Bussia</i>, which are Countries much inhabited, and with great
people. From thence I went into the <i>Land of Lying</i>, where I found store
of the Brethren of our Religion, and many other beside, who shunned
all paine and labour, onely for the love of God, and cared as little, for
the paines and travailes which others tooke, except some benefit arised
thereby to them; nor spend they any money in this Country, but such
as is without stampe. Thence I went into the Land of <i>Abruzzi</i>, where
the men and women goe in Galoches over the Mountaines, and make
them garments of their Swines guts. Not farre from thence, I found
people, that carried bread in their staves, and wine in Satchels, when
parting from them, I arrived among the Mountaines of <i>Bacchus</i>, where
all the waters run downe with a deepe fall, and in short time, I went on
so far, that I found my selfe to be in <i>India Pastinaca</i>; where I swear to you
by the holy habit which I weare on my body, that I saw Serpents flye,
things incredible, and such as were never seene before.</p>

<p>But because I would be loth to lye, so soone as I departed thence, I
met with <i>Maso de Saggio</i>, who was a great Merchant there, and whom
I found cracking Nuts, and selling Cockles by retale. Neverthelesse, al
this while I could not finde what I sought for, and therefore I was to
passe from hence by water, if I intended to travaile thither, and so in returning
back, I came into the <i>Holy Land</i>, where coole fresh bread is sold
for fourepence, and the hot is given away for nothing. There I found
the venerable Father (blame me not I beseech you) the most woorthie
Patriarch of <i>Jerusalem</i>, who for the reverence due to the habite I weare,
and love to our Lord Baron Saint <i>Anthony</i>, would have me to see al the
holy Reliques, which he had there under his charge: whereof there were
so many, as if I should recount them all to you, I never could come to a
conclusion. But yet, not to leave you discomforted, I will relate some
few of them to you.</p>

<p>First of all, he shewed me the finger of the holy Ghost, so whole and
perfect, as ever it was. Next, the nose of the Cherubin, which appeared
to Saint <i>Frances</i>; with the payring of the naile of a Seraphin; and one
of the ribbes of <i>Verbum caro</i>, fastened to one of the Windowes, covered
with the holy garments of the Catholique Faith. Then he tooke me
into a darke Chappel, where he shewed me divers beames of the Starre
that appeared to the three Kings in the East. Also a Violl of Saint <i>Michaels</i>
sweate, when he combatted with the divell: And the jaw-bone of
dead <i>Lazarus</i>, with many other precious things beside. And because I
was liberall to him, giving him two of the Plaines of <i>Monte Morello</i>,
in the Vulgare Edition, and some of the Chapters <i>del Caprezio</i>, which
he had long laboured in search of; he bestowed on me some of his Reliques.</p>

<p>First, he gave me one of the eye-teeth of <i>Santa Crux</i>; and a little Violl,
filled with some part of the sound of those Belles, which hung in the
sumptuous Temple of <i>Salomon</i>. Next, he gave mee the Feather of the
Phoenix, which was with <i>Noah</i> in the Arke, as before I told you. And
one of the Woodden Pattens, which the good Saint <i>Gerrard de Magnavilla</i>
used to weare in his travailes, and which I gave (not long since) to
<i>Gerrardo di Bousy</i> at <i>Florence</i>, where it is respected with much devotion.
Moreover, he gave me a few of those Coales, wherewith the Phoenix
of <i>Noah</i> was roasted; all which things I brought away thence with
me. Now, most true it is, that my Superiour would never suffer mee to
shew them any where, untill he was faithfully certified, whether they
were the same precious Reliques, or no. But perceyving by sundrie
Myracles which they have wrought, and Letters of sufficient credence
receyved from the reverend Patriarch, that all is true, he hath graunted
me permission to shew them, and because I wold not trust any one with
matters of such moment, I my selfe brought them hither with me.</p>

<p>Now I must tell you, that the Feather of the same Phoenix, I conveyed
into a small Cabinet or Casket, because it should not be bent or broken.
And the Coales wherewith the said Phoenix was roasted, I put into
another Casket, in all respects so like to the former, that many times I
have taken one for another. As now at this instant it hath bin my fortune:
for, imagining that I brought the Casket with the feather, I mistooke my
self, &amp; brought the other with the coales. Wherein doubtles I have not
offended, because I am certaine, that we of our Order do not any thing,
but it is ordred by divine direction, and our blessed Patron the Lorde
Baron Saint <i>Anthony</i>. And so much the rather, because about a senight
hence, the Feast of Saint <i>Anthony</i> is to bee solemnized, against the preparation
whereof, and to kindle your zeale with the greater fervencie:
he put the Casket with the Coales into my hand, meaning, to let you
see the Feather, at some more fitting season. And therefore my blessed
Sonnes and Daughters, put off your Bonnets, and come hither with devotion
to looke upon them. But first let me tell you, whosoever is marked
by any of these Coales, with the signe of the Crosse: he or she shal
live all this yeare happily, and no fire whatsoever shall come neere to
touch or hurt them. So, singing a solemne Antheme in the praise of S.
<i>Anthony</i>, he unveyled the Casket, and shewed the Coales openly.</p>

<p>The simple multitude, having (with great admiration and reverence)
a long while beheld them, they thronged in crouds to Fryar <i>Onyon</i>, giving
him farre greater offerings, then before they had, and entreating
him to marke them each after other. Whereupon, he taking the coales
in his hand, began to marke their garments of white, and the veyles on
the Womens heads, with Crosses of no meane extendure: affirming
to them, that the more the Coales wasted with making those great crosses,
the more they still encreased in the Casket, as often before hee had
made triall.</p>

<p>In this manner, having crossed all the <i>Certaldanes</i> (to his great benefit)
and their abuse: he smiled at his sodaine and dexterious devise, in
mockery of them, who thought to have made a scorne of him, by dispossessing
him of the Feather. For <i>Bragoniero</i> and <i>Pizzino</i>, being present
at his Learned predication, and having heard what a cunning shift
he found, to come off cleanly, without the least detection, and all delivered
with such admirable protestations: they were faine to forsake the
Church, least they should have burst with laughing.</p>

<p>But when all the people were parted and gone, they met Friar <i>Onyon</i>
at his Inne, where closely they discovered to him, what they had
done, delivering him his Feather againe: which the yeare
following, did yeeld him as much money, as
now the Coales had
done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This Novell affoorded equall pleasing to the whole companie,
Friar <i>Onyons</i> Sermon being much commended, but especially
his long Pilgrimage, and the Reliques he had both seene, and
brought home with him. Afterward, the Queene perceiving, that her
reigne had now the full expiration, graciously she arose, and taking the
Crowne from off her owne head, placed on the head of <i>Dioneus</i>, saying.
It is high time <i>Dioneus</i>, that you should taste part of the charge &amp; paine,
which poore women have felt and undergone in their soveraigntie and
government: wherefore, be you our King, and rule us with such awefull
authority, that the ending of your dominion may yeelde us all contentment.
<i>Dioneus</i> being thus invested with the Crowne, returned this
answer.</p>

<p>I make no doubt (bright Beauties) but you many times have seene as
good, or a better King among the Chesse-men, then I am. But yet of a
certainty, if you would be obedient to me, as you ought in dutie unto a
true King: I should grant you a liberall freedome of that, wherein you
take the most delight, and without which, our choisest desires can never
be compleate. Neverthelesse, I meane, that my government shal be according
to mine owne minde. So, causing the Master of the Houshold
to be called for, as all the rest were wont to do for conference with him:
he gave him direction, for al things fitting the time of his Regiment, and
then turning to the Ladies, thus he proceeded.</p>

<p>Honest Ladies, we have alreadie discoursed of variable devises, and
so many severall manners of humane industry, concerning the busines
wherewith <i>Licisca</i> came to acquaint us: that her very words, have ministred
me matter, sufficient for our morrowes conference, or else I stand
in doubt, that I could not have devised a more convenient Theame for
us to talke on. She (as you have all heard) saide, that shee had not anie
neighbour, who came a true Virgin to her Husband, and added moreover,
that she knew some others, who had beguiled their Husbandes, in
very cunning and crafty manner. But setting aside the first part, concerning
the proofe of children, I conceive the second to bee more apte
for our intended argument. In which respect, my will is (seeing <i>Licisca</i>
hath given us so good an occasion) that our discoursing to morrow, may
onely concerne such slye cunning and deceits, as women have heeretofore
used, for satisfying their owne appetites, and beguiling their Husbands,
without their knowledge, or suspition, and cleanly escaping with
them, or no.</p>

<p>This argument seemed not very pleasing to the Ladies, and therefore
they urged an alteration thereof, to some matter better suting with the
day, and their discoursing: whereto thus he answered. Ladies, I know
as well as your selves, why you would have this instant argument altered:
but, to change me from it you have no power, considering the season
is such, as shielding all (both men and women) from meddling with
any dishonest action; it is lawfull for us to speake of what wee please.
And know you not, that through the sad occasion of the time, which
now over-ruleth us, the Judges have forsaken their venerable benches,
the Lawes (both divine and humane) ceasing, granting ample license to
every one, to do what best agreeth with the conservation of life? Therefore,
if your honesties doe straine themselves a little, both in thinking
and speaking, not for prosecution of any immodest deede, but onely for
familiar and blamelesse entercourse: I cannot devise a more convenient
ground, at least that carrieth apparant reason, for reproofe of perils, to
ensue by any of you. Moreover, your company, which hath bin most
honest, since the first day of our meeting, to this instant: appeareth not
any jot to be disgraced, by any thing either said or done, neither shal be
(I hope) in the meanest degree.</p>

<p>And what is he, knowing your choise and vertuous dispositions, so
powerfull in their owne prevailing, that wanton words cannot misguide
your wayes, no nor the terror of death it selfe, that dare insinuate a distempred
thought? But admit, that some slight or shallow judgements,
hearing you (perhaps sometimes) talke of such amorous follies, should
therefore suspitiously imagine you to be faulty, or else you would bee
more sparing of speech? Their wit and censure are both alike, favouring
rather of their owne vile nature, who would brand others with their
basebred imperfections. Yet there is another consideration beside, of som
great injury offered to mine honour, and whereof I know not how you
can acquit your selves.</p>

<p>I that have bin obedient to you all, and borne the heavy load of your
businesse, having now (with full consent) created mee your King, you
would wrest the law out of my hands, and dispose of my authoritie as
you please. Forbeare (gentle Ladies) all frivolous suspitions, more fit
for them that are full of bad thoughts, then you, who have true Vertue
shining in your eyes; and therefore, let every one freely speake their
minde, according as their humors best pleaseth them.</p>

<p>When the Ladies heard this, they made answer, that all should bee
answerable to his minde. Whereupon, the King gave them all leave to
dispose of themselves till supper time. And because the Sun was yet very
high, in regard all the re counted Novels had bin so short: <i>Dioneus</i>
went to play at the Tables with another of the young Gentlemen, &amp; Madame
<i>Eliza</i>, having withdrawne the Ladies aside, thus spake unto them.
During the time of our being heere, I have often bene desirous to let you
see a place somwhat neere at hand, and which I suppose you have never
seene, it being called <i>The Valley of Ladies</i>. Till now, I could not finde any
convenient time to bring you thither, the Sunne continuing still aloft,
which fitteth you with the apter leysure, and the sight (I am sure)
can no way discontent you.</p>

<p>The Ladies replyed, that they were all ready to walk with her thither:
and calling one of their women to attend on them, they set on, without
speaking a word to any of the men. And within the distance of halfe a
mile, they arrived at the <i>Valley of Ladies</i>, whereinto they entred by a strait
passage at the one side, from whence there issued forth a cleare running
River. And they found the saide Valley to bee so goodly and pleasant,
especially in that season, which was the hottest of all the yeare; as all the
world was no where able to yeeld the like. And, as one of the said Ladies
(since then) related to mee, there was a plaine in the Valley so directly
round, as if it had beene formed by a compasse, yet rather it resembled
the Workmanship of Nature, then to be made by the hand of
man: containing in circuite somewhat more then the quarter of a mile,
environed with sixe small hils, of no great height, and on each of them
stood a little Palace, shaped in the fashion of Castles.</p>

<p>The ground-plots descending from those hils or mountaines, grew
lesse and lesse by variable degrees, as wee observe at entering into our
Theaters, from the highest part to the lowest, succinctly to narrow the
circle by order. Now, concerning these ground-plottes or little Meadowes,
those which the Sun Southward looked on, were full of Vines,
Olive-trees, Almond-trees, Cherry-trees, and Figge-trees, with divers
other Trees beside, so plentifully bearing fruites, as you could not
discerne a hands bredth of losse. The other Mountaines, whereon the
Northerne windes blow, were curiously covered with small Thickets
or Woods of Oakes, Ashes, and other Trees so greene and straite, as
it was impossible to behold fairer. The goodly plaine it selfe, not having
any other entrance, but where the Ladies came in, was planted
with Trees of Firre, Cipresse, Laurell, and Pines; so singularly growing
in formall order, as if some artificiall or cunning hand had planted
them, the Sun hardly piercing through their branches, from the top to
the bottome, even at his highest, or any part of his course.</p>

<p>All the whole field was richly spred with grasse, and such variety of
delicate Flowers, as Nature yeilded out of her plenteous Store-house.
But that which gave no lesse delight then any of the rest, was a small running
Brooke, descending from one of the Vallies, that divided two of
the little hils, and fell through a Veine of the intire Rocke it selfe, that
the fall and murmure thereof was most delightfull to heare, seeming all
the way in the descent, like Quicke-silver, weaving it selfe into artificiall
workes, and arriving in the plaine beneath, it was there receyved
into a small Channell, swiftly running through the midst of the plaine,
to a place where it stayed, and shaped it selfe into a Lake or Pond, such
as our Citizens have in their Orchards or Gardens, when they please to
make use of such a commodity.</p>

<p>This Pond was no deeper, then to reach the breast of a man, and having
no mud or soyle in it, the bottome thereof shewed like small beaten
gravell, with pretty pibble stones intermixed, which some that had
nothing else to do, would sit downe and count them as they lay, as very
easily they might. And not onely was the bottome thus apparantly
seene, but also such plenty of Fishes swimming every way, as the mind
was never to be wearied in looking on them. Nor was this water bounded
in with any bankes, but onely the sides of the plain Medow, which
made it appeare the more sightly, as it arose in swelling plenty. And alwayes
as it super-abounded in his course, least it should overflow disorderly:
it fell into another Channell, which conveying it along the lower
Valley, ran forth to water other needfull places.</p>

<p>When the Ladies were arrived in this goodly valley, and upon advised
viewing it, had sufficiently commended it: in regard the heat of the
day was great, the place tempting, and the Pond free from sight of any,
they resolved there to bathe themselves. Wherefore they sent the waiting
Gentlewoman to have a diligent eye on the way where they entered,
least any one should chance to steale upon them. All seven of them
being stript naked, into the water they went, which hid their delicate
white bodies, like as a cleare Glasse concealeth a Damask Rose within it.
So they being in the Pond, and the water nothing troubled by their being
there, they found much pretty pastime together, running after the
Fishes, to catch them with their hands, but they were over-quicke and
cunning for them. After they had delighted themselves there to their
owne contentment, and were cloathed with their garments, as before:
thinking it fit time for their returning backe againe, least their over-long
stay might give offence, they departed thence in an easie pace, dooing
nothing else all the way as they went, but extolling the <i>Valley of Ladies</i>
beyond all comparison.</p>

<p>At the Palace they arrived in a due houre, finding the three Gentlemen
at play, as they left them, to whom Madame <i>Pampinea</i> pleasantly
thus spake. Now trust me Gallants, this day wee have very cunningly
beguiled you. How now? answered <i>Dioneus</i>, begin you first to act, before
you speake? Yes truly Sir, replyed Madame <i>Pampinea</i>: Relating
to him at large, from whence they came, what they had done there,
the beautie of the place, and the distance thence. The King (upon hir
excellent report) being very desirous to see it; sodainely commaunded
Supper to be served in, which was no sooner ended, but they and their
three servants (leaving the Ladies) walked on to the <i>Valley</i>, which when
they had considered, no one of them having ever bin there before; they
thought it to be the Paradise of the World.</p>

<p>They bathed themselves there likewise, as the Ladies formerlie had
done, and being re-vested, returned backe to their Lodgings, because
darke night drew on apace: but they found the Ladies dauncing, to a
Song which Madame <i>Fiammetta</i> sung. When the dance was ended,
they entertained the time with no other discourse, but onely concerning
the <i>Valley of Ladies</i>, whereof they all spake liberally in commendations.
Whereupon, the King called the Master of the Houshold, giving
him command, that (on the morrow) dinner should be readie betimes,
and bedding to be thence carried, if any desired rest at mid-time
of the day.</p>

<p>All this being done, variety of pleasing Wines were brought, Banquetting
stuffe, and other dainties; after which they fell to Dauncing.
And <i>Pamphilus</i>, having receyved command, to begin an especiall dance,
the King turned himselfe unto Madame <i>Eliza</i>, speaking thus. Faire Lady,
you have done me so much honour this day, as to deliver mee the
Crowne: in regard whereof, be you this night the Mistresse of the song:
and let it be such as best may please your selfe. Whereunto Madam
<i>Eliza</i>, with a modest blush arising in her face, replyed; That his will
should be fulfilled, and then (with a delicate voyce) she beganne in this
manner.</p>

<p>After that Madame <i>Eliza</i> had made an end of her Song, which shee
sealed up with an heart-breaking sigh: they all sate amazedly wondering
at her moanes, not one among them being able to conjecture, what
should be the reason of her singing in this manner. But the King being
in a good and pleasing temper, calling <i>Tindaro</i>, commaunded him to
bring his Bagge-pipe, by the sound whereof they danced divers daunces:
And a great part of the night being spent in this manner,
they all gave over, and departed to their
Chambers.</p>

<h4><i>The End of the Sixth Day.</i></h4>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="The_Seventh_Day" id="The_Seventh_Day">The Seventh Day.</a></h2>

<h4><i>When the Assembly being met together, and under
the Regiment of</i> Dioneus: <i>the Discourses are directed, for the discoverie
of such policies and deceites, as women have used for beguiling of their
Husbandes, either in respect of their love, or for the prevention of some
blame or scandal, escaping without sight, knowledge or otherwise.</i></h4>

<h4>The Induction to the Dayes
Discourses.</h4>


<p>All the Starres were departed out of the East,
but onely that, which we commonly cal bright
<i>Lucifer</i>, or the Day-Star, gracing the morning
very gloriously: when the Master of the household,
being risen, went with all the provision,
to the <i>Valley of Ladies</i>, to make everie thing in
due and decent readines, according as his Lord
over-night had commanded him. After which
departure of his, it was not long before the King arose, beeing awaked
with the noise which the carriages made; and when he was up, the other
two Gentlemen and the Ladies were quickly readie soone after.
On they set towards the <i>Valley</i>, even as the Sunne was rising: and all
the way as they went, never before had they heard so many sweete
Nightingales, and other pretty Birds melodiously singing, as they did
this morning, which keeping them company thoroughout the journey,
they arrived at the <i>Valley of Ladies</i>, where it seemed to them, that infinite
Quires of delicate Nightingales, and other Birds, had purposely made
a meeting, even as it were to give them a glad welcome thither.</p>

<p>Divers times they walked about the <i>Valley</i>, never satisfied with viewing
it from one end to the other; because it appeared farre more pleasing
unto them, then it had done the precedent day: and because the
dayes splendour was much more conforme to the beauty thereof. After
they had broken their fast, with excellent Wines and Banquetting
stuffe, they began to tune their instruments and sing; because (therein)
the sweet Birds should not excell them, the <i>Valley</i> (with delicate Echoes)
answering all their notes. When dinner time drew neere, the Tables
were covered under the spreading trees, and by the goodly Ponds side,
where they sate downe orderly by the Kings direction: and all dinner
while, they saw the Fishes swimme by huge shoales in the Pond, which
sometimes gave them occasion to talke, as well as gaze on them.</p>

<p>When dinner was ended, and the Tables withdrawne, in as jocond
manner as before, they renewed againe their hermonious singing. In divers
places of this pleasant <i>Valley</i>, were goodly field-Beds readily furnished,
according as the Master of the Houshold gave enstruction, enclosed
with Pavillions of costly stuffes, such as are sometimes brought out
of <i>France</i>. Such as were so disposed, were licensed by the King to take
their rest: and they that would not, he permitted them to their wonted
pastimes, each according to their minds. But when they were risen from
sleepe, and the rest from their other exercises, it seemed to be more then
high time, that they should prepare for talke and conference. So, sitting
downe on Turky Carpets, which were spred abroad on the green grasse,
and close by the place where they had dined: the King gave command,
that Madam <i>Æmillia</i> should first begin, whereto she willingly yeelding
obedience, and expecting such silent attention, as formerly had bin observed,
thus she began.</p>

<h2>The First Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Reprehending the simplicity of some sottish Husbands: And discovering the
wanton subtilties of some women, to compasse their unlawfull desires.</i></h4>


<p>My Gracious Lord (quoth Madame <i>Æmillia</i>) it
had bene a matter highly pleasing to mee, that
any other (rather than my selfe) should have begun
to speake of this argument, which it hath
pleased you to apoint. But seeing it is your Highnesse
pleasure, that I must make a passage of assurance
for all the rest; I will not be irregular, because
obedience is our cheefe Article. I shall
therefore (Gracious Ladies) strive, to speake something, which may bee
advantageable to you heereafter, in regard, that if other women bee as
fearfull as we, especially of Spirits, of which all our sexe have generally
bin timorous (although, upon my credite, I know not what they are,
nor ever could meete with any, to tell me what they be) you may by the
diligent observation of my Novell: learne a wholsome and holy prayer,
very available, and of precious power, to conjure and drive them away,
whensoever they shall presume to assault you in any place.</p>

<p>There dwelt sometime in <i>Florence</i>, and in the street of Saint <i>Brancazio</i>,
a woollen Weaver, named <i>John</i> of <i>Lorrayne</i>; a man more happy in
his Art, then wise in any thing else beside: because, favouring somewhat
of the <i>Gregorie</i>, and (in very deede) little lesse then an Ideot; Hee
was many times made Captain of the Woollen-Weavers, in the quarters
belonging to <i>Santa Maria Novella</i>, and his house was the Schoole or
receptacle, for all their meetings and assemblies. He had divers other
petty Offices beside, by the dignity and authority whereof, hee supposed
himselfe much exalted or elevated, above the common pitch of other
men. And this humour became the more tractable to him, because
he addicted himselfe oftentimes (as being a man of an easie inclination)
to be a benefactor to the holy Fathers of <i>Santa Maria Novella</i>, giving
(beside his other charitable Almes) to someone a paire of Breeches, to
another a Hood, and to another a whole habit. In reward whereof, they
taught him (by heart) many wholsome prayers, as the <i>Pater noster</i> in
the vulgar tongue; the Song of Saint <i>Alexis</i>; the Lamentations of Saint
<i>Bernard</i>, the Hymne of Madame <i>Matilda</i>, and many other such like
matters, which he kept charily, and repeated usually, as tending to the
salvation of his soule.</p>

<p>This man, had a very faire and lovely wife, named <i>Monna Tessa</i>, the
daughter of <i>Manuccio della Cuculia</i>, wise and well advised; who knowing
the simplicity of her Husband, and affecting <i>Frederigo di Neri Pegolotti</i>,
who was a comely young Gentleman, fresh, and in the floure of his
time, even as she was, therefore they agreed the better together. By
meanes of her Chamber-maid, <i>Frederigo</i> and shee met often together,
at a Countrie Farme of <i>John</i> of <i>Lorraynes</i>, which hee had neere to <i>Florence</i>,
and where she used to lodge all the Summer time, called <i>Camerata</i>,
whether <i>John</i> resorted somtimes to Supper, and lodge for a night,
returning home againe to his City house the next morning; yet often
he would stay there longer with his owne companions.</p>

<p><i>Frederigo</i>, who was no meane man in his Mistresses favor, and therefore
these private meetings the more welcome to him; received a summons
or assignation from her, to be there on such a night, when hir husband
had no intent of comming thither. There they supped merrily
together, and (no doubt) did other things, nothing appertaining to our
purpose, she both acquainting, and well instructing him, in a dozen (at
the least) of her Husbands devout prayers. Nor did shee make any account,
or <i>Frederigo</i> either, that this should be the last time of their meeting,
because (indeede) it was not the first: and therfore they set down
an order and conclusion together (because the Chambermaide must be
no longer the messenger) in such manner as you shall heare.</p>

<p><i>Frederigo</i> was to observe especially, that alwayes when hee went or
came from his owne house, which stood much higher then <i>John</i> of <i>Lorraynes</i>
did, to looke upon a Vine, closely adjoyning to her house, where
stood the scull of an Asses head, advanced upon an high pole; &amp; when
the face thereof looked towards <i>Florence</i>, he might safely come, it being
an assured signe, that <i>John</i> kept at home. And if he found the doore
fast shut, he should softly knocke three severall times, and thereon bee
admitted entrance. But if the face stood towards <i>Fiesola</i>; then he might
not come, for it was the signe of <i>Johns</i> being there, and then there might
be no meddling at all.</p>

<p>Having thus agreed upon this conclusion, and had many merry meetings
together: one night above the rest, where <i>Frederigo</i> was appointed
to suppe with <i>Monna Tessa</i>, who had made ready two fat Capons,
drest in most dainty and delicate manner: it fell out so unfortunately,
that <i>John</i> (whose Kue was not to come that night) came thither very late,
yet before <i>Frederigo</i>, wherewith she being not a little offended, gave <i>John</i>
a slight supper, of Lard, Bacon, and such like coarse provision, because
the other was kept for a better guest. In the meane time, and while <i>John</i>
was at supper, the Maide (by her Mistresses direction) had conveighed
the two Capons, with boyled Egges, Bread and a Bottle of Wine (all
folded up in a faire cleane table cloth) into her Garden, that had a passage
to it, without entering into the house, and where shee had divers
times supt with <i>Frederigo</i>. She further willed the Maide, to set all those
things under a Peach-tree, which adjoyned to the fields side: but, so angry
she was at her husbands unexpected comming, that shee forgot to
bid her tarrie there, till <i>Frederigoes</i> comming; and to tell him of <i>Johns</i>
being there: as also, to take what he found prepared readie for his Supper.</p>

<p><i>John</i> and she being gone to bed together, and the Maide likewise, it
was not long after, before <i>Frederigo</i> came, and knocking once softly at
the doore, which was very neere to their lodging Chamber, <i>John</i> heard
the noise, and so did his wife. But to the end, that <i>John</i> might not have
the least scruple of suspition, she seemed to be fast asleepe; and <i>Frederigo</i>
pausing a while, according to the order directed, knockt againe the second
time. <i>John</i> wondering thereat very much, jogd his wife a little, and
saide to her: <i>Tessa</i>, hearest thou nothing? Me thinkes one knocketh at
our doore. <i>Monna Tessa</i>, who was better acquainted with the knocke,
then plaine honest meaning <i>John</i> was, dissembling as if shee awaked out
of a drowsie dreame, saide: Alas Husband, dost thou know what this
is? In the name of our blessed Ladie, be not affraid, this is but the Spirit
which haunts our Countrey houses, whereof I have often told thee, and
it hath many times much dismayed me, living heere alone without thy
comfort. Nay, such hath bin my feare, that in divers nights past, so
soone as I heard the knockes: I was feigne to hide my selfe in the bedde
over-head and eares (as we usually say) never daring to be so bold, as to
looke out, untill it was broad open day. Arise good wife (quoth <i>John</i>)
and if it be such a Spirit of the Countrey, as thou talkest of, never be affraid;
for before we went to bed, I said the <i>Telucis</i>, the <i>Intemerata</i>, with
many other good prayers beside. Moreover, I made the signe of the
Crosse at every corner of our bed, in the name of the Father,
Son, and holy Ghost, so that no doubt at all needs to be made, of any
power it can have to hurt or touch us.</p>

<p><i>Monna Tessa</i>, because (perhaps) <i>Frederigo</i> might receive some other
suspition, and so enter into distaste of her by anger or offence: determined
to arise indeede, and to let him covertly understand, that <i>John</i> was
there, and therefore saide to her husband. Beleeve me <i>John</i>, thy counsell
is good, and every one of thy words hath wisedome in it: but I hold
it best for our owne safety, thou being heere; that wee should conjure
him quite away, to the end he may never more haunt our house. Conjure
him Wife? Quoth <i>John</i>, By what meanes? and how? Bee patient
good man (quoth <i>Tessa</i>) and I will enstruct thee. I have learned an excellent
kinde of conjuration; for, the last weeke, when I went to procure
the pardons at <i>Fiesola</i>, one of the holy recluse Nuns, who (indeede <i>John</i>)
is my indeered Sister and Friend, and the most sanctimonious in life of
them all; perceiving me to be troubled and terrified by Spirits; taught
me a wholsome and holy prayer, and protested withall, that shee had
often made experiment thereof, before she became a Recluse, &amp; found
it (alwayes) a present helpe to her. Yet never durst I adventure to essay
it, living heere by my selfe all alone: but honest <i>John</i>, seeing thou art
heere with me, we will go both together, and conjure this Spirit. <i>John</i>
replyed, that he was very willing; and being both up, they went fayre
and softly to the doore, where <i>Frederigo</i> stoode still without, and was
growne somewhat suspitious of his long attendance.</p>

<p>When they were come to the doore, <i>Monna Tessa</i> said to <i>John</i>: Thou
must cough and spet, at such time as I shall bid thee. Well (quoth <i>John</i>)
I will not faile you. Immediately she beganne her prayer in this manner.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Bread, and a Bottle of good wine,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>All wrapt up in a cloath most fine.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Is not this good Goblins fare?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Packe and say you have your share;</i><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>No sooner had she ended her devoute conjuring prayer, but she saide
to her husband: Now <i>John</i>, cough and spet: which <i>John</i> accordingly
did. And <i>Frederigo</i>, being all this while without, hearing her witty conjuration
of a Spirit, which he himselfe was supposed to be, being ridde of
his former jealous suspition: in the midst of all his melancholy, could
very hardly refraine from laughing, the jest appeared so pleasing to him:
But when <i>John</i> cought and spet, softly he said to himselfe: When next
thou spetst, spet out all thy teeth.</p>

<p>The woman having three severall times conjured the Spirite, in such
manner you have already heard; returned to bed againe with her husband:
and <i>Frederigo</i>, who came as perswaded to sup with her, being supperlesse
all this while; directed by the words of <i>Monna Tessa</i> in hir praier,
went into the Garden. At the foot of the Peach-tree, there he found
the linnen cloth, with the two hot Capons, Bread, Egges, and a Bottle
of Wine in it, all which he carried away with him, and went to Supper
at better leysure. Oftentimes afterward, upon other meetings of <i>Frederigo</i>
and she together, they laughed heartily at her enchantment, and the
honest beleefe of silly <i>John</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot deny, but that some do affirme, that the Woman had turned
the face of the Asses head towards <i>Fiesola</i>, and a Country Travailer
passing by the Vine, having a long piked staffe on his necke; the staffe,
(by chance) touched the head, and made it turne divers times about, &amp;
in the end faced <i>Florence</i>, which being the cal for <i>Frederigoes</i> comming,
by this meanes he was disappointed. In like manner some say, that <i>Monna
Tessaes</i> prayer for conjuring the Spirit, was in this order.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><i>
<span class="i0">Spirit, Spirit, go thy way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And come againe some other day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was not I that turnd the head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some other. In our Bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are John and I: Go from our dore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see thou trouble us no more.<br /></span>
</i></div></div>

<p>So that <i>Frederigo</i> departed thence, both with the losse of his labour &amp;
supper. But a neighbour of mine, who is a woman of good yeares, told
me, that both the one and other were true, as she her selfe heard, when
she was a little Girle. And concerning the latter accident, it was not to
<i>John</i> of <i>Lorrayne</i>, but to another, named <i>John de Nello</i>, that dwelt at S.
<i>Peters</i> Gate, and of the same profession as <i>John</i> of <i>Lorrayne</i> was. Wherefore
(faire Ladies) it remaineth in your owne choice, to entertain which
of the two prayers you please, or both together if you will: for they are
of extraordinary vertue in such strange occurrences, as you have heeretofore
heard, and (upon doubt) may prove by experience. It shall not
therefore be amisse for you, to learne them both by hart, for (peradventure)
they may stand you in good sted, if ever you chance to have the like
occasion.</p>

<h2>The Second Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is declared, what hard and narrow shifts and distresses, such as bee
seriously linked in Love, are many times enforced to undergo: According
as their owne wit, and capacitie of their surprizers, drive them to in extremities.</i></h4>


<p>Not without much laughter and good liking, was the Tale of
Madame <i>Æmillia</i> listened unto, and both the prayers commended
to be sound and soveraigne: but it being ended, the
King commaunded <i>Philostratus</i>, that hee should follow next in order,
whereupon thus he began.</p>

<p>Deare Ladies, the deceites used by men towards your sexe, but especially
Husbands, have bene so great and many, as when it hath sometime
happened, or yet may, that husbands are requited in the self-same
kinde: you need not finde fault at any such accident, either by knowledge
thereof afterward, or hearing the same reported by any one; but
rather you should referre it to generall publication, to the end, that immodest
men may know, and finde it for trueth, that if they have apprehension
and capacity; women are therein not a jote inferiour to them.
Which cannot but redound to your great benefite, because, when any
one knoweth, that another is as cunning and subtile as himselfe; he will
not be so rashly adventurous in deceite. And who maketh any doubt,
that if those sleights and trickes, whereof this dayes argument may
give us occasion to speake, should afterwardes be put in execution by
men: would it not minister just reason, of punishing themselves for beguiling
you, knowing, that (if you please) you have the like abilitie in
your owne power? Mine intent therefore is to tell you, what a woman
(though but of meane quality) did to her husband, upon a sodaine, and
in a moment (as it were) for her owne safety.</p>

<p>Not long since, there lived in <i>Naples</i>, an honest meane man, who did
take to Wife, a fayre and lustie young Woman, being named <i>Peronella</i>.
He professing the Trade of a Mason, and shee Carding and Spinning,
maintained themselves in a reasonable condition, abating and
abounding as their Fortunes served. It came to passe, that a certayne
young man, well observing the beauty and good parts of <i>Peronella</i>, became
much addicted in affection towardes her: and by his often and
secret sollicitations, which he found not to be unkindely entertayned;
his successe proved answerable to his hope, no unindifferencie appearing
in their purposes, but where her estate seemed weakest, his supplies
made an addition of more strength.</p>

<p>Now, for their securer meeting, to stand cleare from all matter of
scandal or detection, they concluded in this order between themselves.
<i>Lazaro</i>, for so was <i>Peronellaes</i> Husband named, being an earely riser every
morning, either to seeke for worke, or to effect it being undertaken:
this amorous friend being therewith acquainted, and standing in
some such convenient place, where hee could see <i>Lazaroes</i> departure
from his house, and yet himselfe no way discerned; poore <i>Lazaro</i> was
no sooner gone, but presently he enters the house, which stood in a verie
solitarie street, called the <i>Avorio</i>. Many mornings had they thus met
together, to their no meane delight and contentation, till one especiall
morning among the rest, when <i>Lazaro</i> was gone forth to worke, and
<i>Striguario</i> (so was the amorous young man named) visiting <i>Peronella</i> in
the house: upon a very urgent occasion, <i>Lazaro</i> returned backe againe,
quite contrary to his former wont, keeping foorth all day, and never
comming home till night.</p>

<p>Finding his doore to be fast lockt, and he having knockt softlie once
or twice, he spake in this manner to himselfe. Fortune I thanke thee,
for albeit thou hast made mee poore, yet thou hast bestowed a better
blessing on me, in matching me with so good, honest, &amp; loving a Wife.
Behold, though I went early out of my house, her selfe hath risen in the
cold to shut the doore, to prevent the entrance of theeves, or any other
that might offend us. <i>Peronella</i> having heard what her husband sayde,
and knowing the manner of his knocke, said fearfully to <i>Striguario</i>. Alas
deare friend, what shall wee doe? I am little lesse then a dead Woman:
For, <i>Lazaro</i> my Husband is come backe again, and I know not what to
do or say. He never returned in this order before now, doubtlesse, hee
saw when you entred the doore; and for the safety of your honour and
mine: creepe under this brewing Fat, till I have opened the doore, to
know the reason of his so soone returning.</p>

<p><i>Striguario</i> made no delaying of the matter, but got himselfe closelie
under the Fat, and Peronella opening the doore for her husbands enterance,
with a frowning countenance, spake thus unto him. What meaneth
this so early returning home againe this morning? It seemeth, thou
intendest to do nothing to day, having brought backe thy tooles in thy
hands. If such be thine intent, how shall we live? Where shal we have
bread to fill our bellies? Dooest thou thinke, that I will suffer thee to
pawne my gowne, and other poore garments, as heeretofore thou hast
done? I that card and spinne both night and day, till I have worne the
flesh from my fingers; yet all will hardly finde oyle to maintaine our
Lampe. Husband, husband, there is not one neighbour dwelling by
us, but makes a mockerie of me, and tels me plainly, that I may be ashamed
to drudge and moyle as I do; wondering not a little, how I am able
to endure it; and thou returnest home with thy hands in thy hose, as if
thou hadst no worke at all to do this day.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, she fell to weeping, and then thus began again.
Poore wretched woman as I am, in an unfortunate houre was I borne,
and in a much worse, when I was made thy Wife. I could have had a
proper, handsome young man; one, that would have maintained mee
brave and gallantly: but, beast as I was, to forgoe my good, and cast
my selfe away on such a beggar as thou art, and whom none wold have
had, but such an Asse as I. Other women live at hearts ease, and in jollity,
have their amorous friends and loving Paramours, yea, one, two,
three at once, making their husbands looke like a Moone cressent, whereon
they shine Sun-like, with amiable lookes, because they know not how
to helpe it: when I (poore foole) live heere at home a miserable life, not
daring once to dreame of such follies, an innocent soule, heartlesse and
harmelesse.</p>

<p>Many times, sitting and sighing to my selfe: Lord, thinke I, of what
mettall am I made? Why should not I have a Friend in a corner, as well
as others have? I am flesh and blood, as they are, not made of brasse or
iron, and therefore subject to womens frailty. I would thou shouldest
know it husband, and I tell it thee in good earnest; That if I would doe
ill, I could quickely finde a friend at a neede. Gallants there are good
store, who (of my knowledge) love me dearely, and have made me very
large and liberall promises, of Golde, Silver, Jewels, and gay Garments,
if I would extend them the least favour. But my heart will not
suffer me, I never was the daughter of such a mother, as had so much as
a thought of such matters: no, I thanke our blessed Ladie, and S. <i>Friswid</i>
for it: and yet thou returnest home againe, when thou shouldst be at
Worke.</p>

<p><i>Lazaro</i>, who stoode all this while like a well-beleeving Logger-head,
demurely thus answered. Alas good Wife! I pray you bee not so angry,
I never had so much as an ill thought of you, but know wel enough
what you are, and have made good proofe thereof this morning. Understand
therefore patiently (sweet Wife) that I went forth to my work
as dayly I use to do, little dreaming (as I thinke you doe not) that it had
bene Holy-day. Wife, this is the Feast day of Saint <i>Galeone</i>; whereon
we may in no wise worke, and this is the reason of my so soone returning.
Neverthelesse (deare Wife) I was not carelesse of our Houshold
provision: For, though we worke not, yet we must have foode, which I
have provided for more then a moneth. Wife, I remembred the brewing
Fat, whereof wee have little or no use at all, but rather it is a trouble
to the house, then otherwise. I met with an honest Friend, who stayeth
without at the doore, to him I have sold the Fat for ten <i>Gigliatoes</i>, and he
tarrieth to take it away with him.</p>

<p>How Husband? replied <i>Peronella</i>, Why now I am worse offended
then before. Thou that art a man, walkest every where, and shouldst be
experienced in worldly affaires: wouldst thou bee so simple, as to sell
such a brewing Fat for ten <i>Gigliatoes</i>? Why, I that am a poore ignorant
woman, a house-Dove, sildome going out of my doore: have sold it already
for twelve <i>Gigliatoes</i>, to a very honest man, who (even a little before
thy comming home) came to me, we agreed on the bargaine, and he
is now underneath the Fat, to see whether it be sound or no. When credulous
<i>Lazaro</i> heard this, he was better contented then ever, and went
to him that taried at the doore, saying. Good man, you may goe your
way, for, whereas you offered me but ten <i>Gigliatoes</i> for the Fat, my loving
wife hath sold it for twelve, and I must maintaine what shee hath
done: so the man departed, and the variance ended.</p>

<p><i>Peronella</i> then saide to her husband. Seeing thou art come home so
luckily, helpe me to lift up the Fat, that the man may come foorth, and
then you two end the bargaine together. <i>Striguario</i>, who though he was
mewed up under the tubbe, had his eares open enough; and hearing the
witty excuse of <i>Peronella</i>, tooke himselfe free from future feare: and being
come from under the Fat, pretending also, as if he had herd nothing,
nor saw <i>Lazaro</i>, looking round about him, said. Where is this good woman?
<i>Lazaro</i> stepping forth boldly like a man, replyed: Heere am I,
what wold you have Sir? Thou? quoth <i>Striguario</i>, what art thou? I ask
for the good wife, with whom I made my match for the Fat. Honest
Gentleman (answered <i>Lazaro</i>) I am that honest Womans Husband,
for lacke of a better, and I will maintaine whatsoever my Wife hath
done.</p>

<p>I crie you mercie Sir, replyed <i>Striguario</i>, I bargained with your Wife
for this brewing Fat, which I finde to be whole and sound: only it is uncleane
within, hard crusted with some dry soile upon it, which I know
not well how to get off, if you will be the meanes of making it cleane, I
have the money heere ready for it. For that Sir (quoth <i>Peronella</i>) take
you no care, although no match at all had beene made, what serves my
Husband for, but to make it cleane? Yes forsooth Sir, answered sily <i>Lazaro</i>,
you shall have it neate and cleane before you pay the mony.</p>

<p>So, stripping himselfe into his shirt, lighting a Candle, and taking
tooles fit for the purpose; the Fat was whelmed over him, and he being
within it, wrought untill he sweated, with scraping and scrubbing. So
that these poore Lovers, what they could not accomplish as they wold,
necessity enforced them to performe as they might. And <i>Peronella</i>, looking
in at the vent-hole, where the Liquor runneth forth for the meshing;
seemed to instruct her husband in the businesse, as espying those
parts where the Fat was fowlest, saying: There, there <i>Lazaro</i>, tickle it
there, the Gentleman payes well for it, and is worthy to have it: but see
thou do thy selfe no harme good Husband. I warrant thee Wife, answered
<i>Lazaro</i>, hurt not your selfe with leaning your stomacke on the
Fat, and leave the cleansing of it to me. To be breefe, the Brewing Fat
was neatly cleansed, <i>Peronella</i> and <i>Striguario</i> both well pleased, the money
paide, and honest meaning <i>Lazaro</i> not discontented.</p>

<h4><a name="Friar_Reynard_falling_in_love_with_a_Gentlewoman_Wife_to_a_man_of_good" id="Friar_Reynard_falling_in_love_with_a_Gentlewoman_Wife_to_a_man_of_good"><i>Friar</i> Reynard, <i>falling in love with a Gentlewoman, Wife to a man of good
account; found the meanes to become her Gossip. Afterward, he being conferring
closely with her in her Chamber, and her Husband coming sodainly
thither: she made him beleeve, that he came thither for no other end; but
to cure his God-sonne by a charme, of a dangerous disease which he had by
Wormes.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Third Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Serving as a friendly advertisement to married women, that Monks, Friars,
and Priests may be none of their Gossips, in regard of unavoydable perilles
ensuing thereby.</i></h4>

<p><i>Philostratus</i> told not this Tale so covertly, concerning <i>Lazaros</i>
simplicity, and <i>Peronellaes</i> witty policy; but the Ladies found
a knot in the rush, and laughed not a little, at his queint manner
of discoursing it. But upon the conclusion, the King looking upon
Madam <i>Eliza</i>, willed her to succeede next, which as willingly she granted,
and thus began. Pleasant Ladies, the charme or conjuration wherewith
Madam <i>Æmillia</i> laid her night-walking Spirit, maketh me remember
a Novell of another enchantment; which although it carrieth not
commendation equall to the other, yet I intend to report it, because it
suteth with our present purpose, and I cannot sodainly be furnisht with
another, answerable thereto in nature.</p>

<p>You are to understand then, that there lived in <i>Siena</i>, a proper young
man, of good birth and well friended, being named <i>Reynard</i>. Earnestly
he affected his neere dwelling neighbour, a beautifull Gentlewoman,
and wife to a man of good esteeme: of whom hee grew halfe perswaded,
that if he could (without suspition) compasse private conference
with her, he should reach the height of his amorous desires. Yet seeing
no likely meanes wherewith to further his hope, and shee being great
with childe, he resolved to become a Godfather to the childe, at such
time as it should be brought to Christening. And being inwardly acquainted
with her Husband, who was named <i>Credulano</i>; such familiar
entercourses passed betweene them, both of <i>Reynards</i> kinde offer, and
<i>Credulanoes</i> as courteous acceptance, that hee was set downe for a Gossippe.</p>

<p><i>Reynard</i> being thus embraced for Madam <i>Agnesiaes</i> Gossip, and this
proving the onely colourable meanes, for his safer permission of speech
with her, to let her now understand by word of mouth, what long before
she collected by his lookes and behaviour: it fell out no way beneficiall
to him, albeit <i>Agnesia</i> seemed not nice or scrupulous in hearing,
yet she had a more precious care of her honour. It came to passe, within
a while after (whether by seeing his labour vainly spent, or some other
urgent occasion moving him thereto, I know not) <i>Reynard</i> would needs
enter into Religion, and whatsoever strictnesse or austeritie hee found
to be in that kinde of life, yet he determined to persevere therein, whether
it were for his good or ill. And although within a short space, after
he was thus become a Religious Monke, hee seemed to forget the
former love which he bare to his gossip <i>Agnesia</i>, and divers other enormous
vanities beside: yet let me tell you, successe of time tutord him
in them againe; and, without any respect to his poore holy habite, but
rather in contempt thereof (as it were) he tooke an especiall delight, in
wearing garments of much richer esteeme, yet favoured by the same
Monasticall profession, appearing (in all respects) like a Court-Minion
or Favourite, of a sprightly and Poeticall disposition, for composing
Verses, Sonnets, and Canzons, singing them to sundry excellent instruments,
and yet not greatly curious of his company, so they were some
of the best, and Madame <i>Agnesia</i> one, his former Gossip.</p>

<p>But why doe I trouble my selfe, in talking thus of our so lately converted
Friar, holy Father <i>Reynard</i>, when they of longer standing, and
reputed meerely for Saints in life, are rather much more vile then hee?
Such is the wretched condition of this world, that they shame not (fat,
soggie, and nastie Abbey-lubbers) to shew how full fedde they live in
their Cloysters, with cherry cheekes, and smooth shining lookes, gay
and gaudy garments, far from the least expression of humility, not walking
in the streets like Doves: but high-crested like Cockes, with well
cramd gorges. Nay, which is worse, if you did but see their Chambers
furnished with Gally-pots of Electuaries, precious Unguents, Apothecary
Boxes, filled with various Confections, Conserves, excellent Perfumes,
and other goodly Glasses of artificiall Oyles and Waters: beside
Rundlets and small Barrels full of Greeke Wine, <i>Muscatella, Lachrime
Christi,</i> and other such like most precious Wines, so that (to such as see
them) they seeme not to bee Chambers of Religious men; but rather
Apothecaries Shoppes, or appertaining to Druggists, Grocers, or Perfumers.</p>

<p>It is no disgrace to them to be Gowty; because when other men know
it not, they alledge, that strict fasting, feeding on grosse meates (though
never so little,) continuall studying, and such like restraints from the bodies
freer exercise, maketh them subject to many infirmities. And yet,
when any one of them chanceth to fall sicke, the Physitian must minister
no such counsell to them, as Chastity, Abstinence from voluptuous
meats, Discipline of the body, or any of those matters appertaining to a
modest religious life. For, concerning the plaine, vulgar, and Plebeian
people, these holy Fathers are perswaded, that they know nothing really
belonging to a sanctimonious life; as long watching, praying, discipline
and fasting, which (in themselves) are not able, to make men look
leane, wretched, and pale. Because Saint <i>Dominicke</i>, Saint <i>Fraunces</i>,
and divers other holy Saints beside, observed the selfesame religious orders
and constitutions, as now their carefull successors do. Moreover,
in example of those fore-named Saints, who went wel cloathed, though
they had not three Garments for one, nor made of the finest Woollen
excellent cloath: but rather of the very coarsest of all other, and of the
common ordinary colour, to expell cold onely, but not to appear brave
or gallant, deceyving thereby infinite simple credulous soules, whose
purses (neverthelesse) are their best pay-masters.</p>

<p>But leave we this, and returne wee backe to vertuous Fryar <i>Reynard</i>,
who falling againe to his former appetites; became an often visitant of
his Gossip <i>Agnesia</i>, and now hee had learned such a blushlesse kinde of
boldnesse; that he durst be more instant with her (concerning his privie
sute) then ever formerly he had bin, yea, even to solicite the enjoying of
his immodest desires. The good Gentlewoman, seeing her selfe so importunately
pursued, and Fryar <i>Reynard</i> appearing now (perhappes) of
sweeter and more delicate complexion, then at his entrance into Religion:
at a set time of his secret communing with her; she answered him in
as apt tearmes, as they use to do, who are not greatly squeamish, in granting
matters demanded of them.</p>

<p>Why how now Friar <i>Reynard</i>? quoth shee, Doe God-fathers use to
move such questions? Whereto the Friar thus replyed. Madam, when
I have laide off this holy habite (which is a matter very easie for mee to
do) I shall seeme in your eye, in all respects made like another man, quite
from the course of any Religious life. <i>Agnesia</i>, biting the lip with a pretty
smile, said, O my faire Starres! You will never bee so unfriendly to
me. What? You being my Gossip, would you have me consent unto
such a sinne? Our blessed Lady shield mee, for my ghostly Father hath
often told me, that it is utterly unpardonable: but if it were, I feare too
much confiding on mine owne strength. Gossip, Gossip, answered the
Friar, you speake like a Foole, and feare (in this case) is wholly frivolous,
especially, when the motions mooved by such an one as my selfe,
who (upon repentance) can grant you pardon and indulgence presently.
But I pray you let mee aske you one question, Who is the neerest
Kinsman to your Son; either I, that stood at the Font for his Baptisme,
or your Husband that begot him? The Lady made answere, that it was
her Husband. You say very true Gossip, replyed the Friar, and yet
notwithstanding, doth not your Husband (both at boord and bed) enjoy
the sweet benefit of your company? Yes, said the Lady, why shold
he not? Then Lady (quoth <i>Reynard</i>) I, who am not so neere a Kinsman
to your Sonne, as your Husband is, why may ye not afford mee the like
favour, as you do him? <i>Agnesia</i>, who was no Logitian, and therefore
could not stand on any curious answer, especially being so cuningly moved;
beleeved, or rather made shew of beleeving, that the Godfather said
nothing but truth, and thus answered. What woman is she (Gossip) that
knoweth how to answer your strange speeches? And, how it came to
passe, I know not, but such an agreement passed betweene them, that, for
once onely (so it might not infrindge the league of Gossip-ship, but that
title to countenance their further intent) such a favour should be affoorded,
so it might stand cleare from suspition.</p>

<p>An especiall time being appointed, when this amorous Combate
should be fought in loves field, Friar <i>Reynard</i> came to his Gossips house,
where none being present to hinder his purpose, but onely the Nursse
which attended on the child, who was an indifferent faire &amp; proper woman:
his holy brother that came thither in his company (because Friars
were not allowed to walke alone) was sent aside with her into the Pigeon
loft, to enstruct her in a new kinde of <i>Pater noster</i>, lately devised in
their holy Convent. In the meane while, as Friar <i>Reynard</i> and <i>Agnesia</i>
were entring into hir chamber, she leading her little son by the hand, and
making fast the doore for their better safety: the Friar laide by his holie
habit, Cowle, Hood, Booke, and Beads, to bee (in all respects) as other
men were. No sooner were they thus entred the Chamber, but her husband
<i>Credulano</i>, being come into the house, and unseen of any, staid not
till he was at the Chamber doore, where hee knockt, and called for his
Wife.</p>

<p>She hearing his voice: Alas Gossip (quoth she) what shall I do? My
Husband knocketh at the doore, and now he will perceive the occasion
of our so familiar acquaintance. <i>Reynard</i> being stript into his Trusse and
straite Strouses, began to tremble and quake exceedingly. I heare your
Husbands tongue Gossip, said he, and seeing no harme as yet hath bin
done, if I had but my garments on againe; wee would have one excuse
or other to serve the turne, but till then you may not open the doore.
As womens wits are sildome gadding abroad, when any necessitie concerneth
them at home: even so <i>Agnesia</i>, being sodainly provided of an
invention, both how to speake and carry her selfe in this extreamitie,
saide to the Friar. Get on your garments quickely, and when you are
cloathed, take your little God-son in your armes, and listning wel what
I shall say, shape your answeres according to my words, and then refer
the matter to me. <i>Credulano</i> had scarsely ended his knocking, but <i>Agnesia</i>
stepping to the doore said: Husband, I come to you. So she opened
the doore, and (going forth to him) with a chearefull countenance thus
spake. Beleeve me Husband, you could not have come in a more happy
time, for our young Son was sodainly extreamly sicke, and (as good
Fortune would have it) our loving Gossip <i>Reynard</i> chanced to come in;
and questionlesse, but by his good prayers and other religious paynes,
we had utterly lost our childe, for he had no life left in him.</p>

<p><i>Credulano</i>, being as credulous as his name imported, seemed ready to
swoune with sodaine conceit: Alas good wife (quoth he) how hapned
this? Sit downe sweet Husband said she, and I wil tell you al. Our child
was sodainly taken with a swouning, wherein I being unskilful, did verily
suppose him to be dead, not knowing what to doe, or say. By good
hap, our Gossip <i>Reynard</i> came in, and taking the childe up in his armes,
said to me. Gossip, this is nothing else but Wormes in the bellie of the
childe, which ascending to the heart, must needs kill the child, without
all question to the contrary. But be of good comfort Gossip, and feare
not, for I can charme them in such sort, that they shall all die, and before
I depart hence, you shall see your Son as healthfull as ever. And
because the manner of this charm is of such nature, that it required prayer
and exorcising in two places at once: Nurse went up with his Holye
Brother into our Pigeon loft, to exercise their devotion there, while we
did the like heere. For none but the mother of the childe must bee present
at such a mystery, nor any enter to hinder the operation of the
charme; which was the reason of making fast the Chamber doore. You
shall see Husband anon the Childe, which is indifferently recovered in
his armes, and if Nurse and his holy Brother were returned from theyr
meditations; he saith, that the charme would then be fully effected: for
the child beginneth to looke chearefull and merry.</p>

<p>So deerely did <i>Credulano</i> love the childe, that hee verily beleeved,
what his Wife had saide, never misdoubting any other treachery: and,
lifting up his eyes, with a vehement sigh, said. Wife, may not I goe in
and take the child into my armes? Oh no, not yet good husband (quoth
she) in any case, least you should overthrow all that is done. Stay but
a little while, I will go in againe, and if all bee well, then will I call you.
In went <i>Agnesia</i> againe, making the doore fast after her, the Fryar having
heard all the passed speeches, by this time he was fitted with his habite,
and taking the childe in his armes, he said to <i>Agnesia</i>. Gossip methought
I heard your Husbands voice, is hee at your Chamber doore?
Yes Gossip <i>Reynard</i> (quoth <i>Credulano</i> without, while <i>Agnesia</i> opened
the doore, and admitted him entrance) indeede it is I. Come in Sir, I
pray you, replyed the Friar, and heere receive your childe of mee, who
was in great danger, of your ever seeing him any more alive. But you
must take order, to make an Image of waxe, agreeing with the stature of
the childe, to be placed on the Altar before the Image of S. <i>Frances</i>, by
whose merites the childe is thus restored to health.</p>

<p>The childe, beholding his Father, made signes of comming to him,
rejoycing merrily, as young infants use to do; and <i>Credulano</i> clasping him
in his armes, wept with conceite of joy, kissing him infinitely, and heartily
thanking his Gossip <i>Reynard</i>, for the recovery of his God-son. The
Friars brotherly Companion, who had given sufficient enstructions to
the Nurse, and a small purse full of Sisters white thred, which a Nunne
(after shrift) had bestowed on him, upon the husbands admittance into
the Chamber (which they easily heard) came in also to them, and seeing
all in very good tearmes, they holpe to make a joyfull conclusion,
the Brother saying to Friar Reynard: Brother, I have finished all those
foure Jaculatory prayers, which you commanded me.</p>

<p>Brother, answered <i>Reynard</i>, you have a better breath then I, and your
successe hath prooved happier then mine, for before the arrivall of my
Gossip <i>Credulano</i>, I could accomplish but two Jaculatory prayers onely.
But it appeareth, that we have both prevailed in our devout desires,
because the childe is perfectly cured. <i>Credulano</i> calling for Wine and
good cheare, feasted both the Friars very jocondly, and then conducting
them forth of his house, without any further intermission, caused
the childs Image of waxe to be made, and sent it to be placed on the Altar
of Saint <i>Frances</i>, among many other the like oblations.</p>

<h2>The Fourth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is manifested, that the malice and subtilty of a Woman, surpasseth
all the Art or Wit in man.</i></h4>


<p>So soone as the King perceyved, that the Novell reported by
Madame <i>Eliza</i> was finished: hee turned himselfe to Madame
<i>Lauretta</i>, and told her it was his pleasure, that she should now
begin the next, whereto she yeelded in this manner. O Love: What,
and how many are thy prevailing forces? How straunge are thy foresights?
And how admirable thine attempts? Where is, or ever was the
Philosopher or Artist, that could enstruct the wiles, escapes, preventions,
and demonstrations, which sodainly thou teachest such, as are thy
apt and understanding Schollers indeede? Certaine it is, that the documents
and eruditions of all other whatsoever, are weak, or of no worth,
in respect of thine: as hath notably appeared, by the remonstrances already
past, and whereto (worthy Ladies) I wil adde another of a simple
woman, who taught her husband such a lesson, as shee never learned of
any, but Love himselfe.</p>

<p>There dwelt sometime in <i>Arezzo</i> (which is a faire Village of <i>Tuscany</i>)
a rich man, named <i>Tofano</i>, who enjoyed in marriage a young beautifull
woman, called <i>Cheta</i>: of whom (without any occasion given, or reason
knowne to himselfe) he became exceeding jealous. Which his wife perceyving,
she grew much offended thereat, and tooke it in great scorne,
that she should be servile to so vile and slavish a condition. Oftentimes,
she demanded of him, from whence this jealousie in him received originall,
he having never seene or heard of any; he could make her no other
answer, but what his owne bad humour suggested, and drove him every
day (almost) to deaths doore, by feare of that which no way needed.
But, whether as a just scourge for this his grosse folly, or a secret decree,
ordained to him by Fortune and the Fates, I am not able to distinguish:
It came so to passe, that a young Gallant made meanes to enjoy her favour,
and she was so discreetly wise in judging of his worthinesse; that
affection passed so farre mutually betweene them, as nothing wanted,
but effects to answere words, suited with time and place convenient, for
which order was taken as best they might, yet to stand free from all suspition.</p>

<p>Among many other evill conditions, very frequent and familiar in
her husband <i>Tofano</i>; he tooke a great delight in drinking, which not only
he held to be a commendable quality, but was alwaies so often solicited
thereto: that <i>Cheta</i> her selfe began to like and allow it in him, feeding
his humor so effectually, with quaffing and carowsing, that (at any
time when she listed) she could make him bowsie beyonde all measure:
and leaving him sleeping in this drunkennesse, would alwayes get her
selfe to bed. By helpe heereof, she compassed the first familiarity with
her friend, yea, divers times after, as occasion served: and so confidently
did she builde on her husbands drunkennesse, that not onely shee adventured
to bring her friend home into her owne house; but also would
as often go to his, which was some-what neere at hand, and abide with
him there, the most part of the night season.</p>

<p>While <i>Cheta</i> thus continued on these amorous courses, it fortuned,
that her slye suspitious husband, beganne to perceive, that though shee
drunke very much with him, yea, untill he was quite spent and gone: yet
she remained fresh and sober still, and thereby imagined strange matters,
that he being fast asleepe, his wife then tooke advantage of his drowsinesse,
and might&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;and so forth. Beeing desirous to make experience
of this his distrust, hee returned home at night (not having drunke
any thing all the whole day) dissembling both by his words and behaviour,
as if he were notoriously drunke indeede. Which his Wife constantly
beleeving, saide to her selfe: That hee had now more neede of
sleepe, then drinke; getting him immediately into his warme bed; and
then going downe the staires againe, softly went out of doores unto her
Friends house, as formerly she had used to do, and there shee remained
untill midnight.</p>

<p><i>Tofano</i> perceiving that his Wife came not to bed, and imagining to
have heard his doore both open and shut: arose out of his bed, and calling
his Wife <i>Cheta</i> divers times, without any answere returned: hee
went downe the staires, and finding the doore but closed too, made it
fast and sure on the inside, and then got him up to the window, to watch
the returning home of his wife, from whence shee came, and then to
make her conditions apparantly knowne. So long there he stayed, till at
the last she returned indeede, and finding the doore so surely shut, shee
was exceeding sorrowful, essaying how she might get it open by strength:
which when <i>Tofano</i> had long suffered her in vaine to approve, thus hee
spake to her. <i>Cheta, Cheta,</i> all thy labour is meerely lost, because heere is
no entrance allowed for thee; therefore return to the place from whence
thou camest, that all thy friends may judge of thy behaviour, and know
what a night-walker thou art become.</p>

<p>The woman hearing this unpleasing language, began to use all humble
entreaties, desiring him (for charities sake) to open the doore and admit
her entrance, because she had not bin in any such place, as his jelous
suspition might suggest to him: but onely to visit a weak &amp; sickly neighbour,
the nights being long, she not (as yet) capeable of sleepe, nor willing
to sit alone in the house. But all her perswasions served to no purpose, he
was so setled in his owne opinion, that all the Town should now
see her nightly gading, which before was not so much as suspected. <i>Cheta</i>
seeing, that faire meanes would not prevaile, shee entred into roughe
speeches and threatnings, saying: If thou wilt not open the doore and let
me come in, I will so shame thee, as never base man was. As how I pray
thee? answered <i>Tofano</i>, what canst thou do to me?</p>

<p>The woman, whom love had inspired with sprightly counsell, ingeniously
enstructing her what to do in this distresse, stearnly thus replyed.
Before I will suffer any such shame as thou intended towards mee, I
will drowne my selfe heere in this Well before our doore, where being
found dead, and thy villanous jealousie so apparantly knowne, beside
thy more then beastly drunkennesse: all the neighbours will constantly
beleeve, that thou didst first strangle me in the house, and afterwardes
threw me into this Well. So either thou must flie upon the supposed offence,
or lose all thy goodes by banishment, or (which is much more fitting
for thee) have thy head smitten off as a wilfull murtherer of thy wife;
for all will judge it to be no otherwise. All which wordes, mooved not
<i>Tofano</i> a jot from his obstinat determination: but he still persisting therein,
thus she spake. I neither can nor will longer endure this base Villanie
of thine: to the mercy of heaven I commit my soul, and stand there my
wheele, a witnesse against so hard-hearted a murtherer.</p>

<p>No sooner had she thus spoke, but the night being so extreamly dark,
as they could not discerne one another; Cheta went to the Well, where
finding a verie great stone, which lay loose upon the brim of the Well,
even as if it had beene layde there on purpose, shee cried out aloud, saying.
Forgive me faire heavens, and so threw the stone downe into the
Well. The night being very still &amp; silent, the fal of the great stone made
such a dreadfull noise in the Well; that he hearing it at the Windowe,
thought verily she had drowned her selfe indeede. Whereupon, running
downe hastily, and taking a Bucket fastened to a strong Cord: he
left the doore wide open, intending speedily to helpe her. But she standing
close at the doores entrance, before he could get to the Wels side;
she was within the house, softly made the doore fast on the inside, and
then went up to the Window, where <i>Tofano</i> before had stood talking
to her.</p>

<p>While he was thus dragging with his Bucket in the Well, crying and
calling <i>Cheta</i>, take hold good <i>Cheta</i>, and save thy life: she stood laughing
in the Window, saying. Water should bee put into Wine before
a man drinkes it, and not when he hath drunke too much already. <i>Tofano</i>
hearing his Wife thus to flout him out of his Window, went back
to the doore, and finding it made fast against him: he willed hir to grant
him entrance. But she, forgetting all gentle Language, which formerly
she had used to him: in meere mockery and derision (yet intermixed
with some sighes and teares, which women are saide to have at command)
out aloud (because the Neighbours should heare her) thus she
replyed.</p>

<p>Beastly drunken Knave as thou art, this night thou shalt not come
within these doores, I am no longer able to endure thy base behaviour,
it is more then high time, that thy course of life should bee publiquely
known, and at what drunken houres thou returnest home to thy house.
<i>Tofano</i>, being a man of very impatient Nature, was as bitter unto her in
words on the other side, which the Neighbours about them (both men
and Women) hearing; looked forth of their Windowes, and demaunding
a reason for this their disquietnesse, <i>Cheta</i> (seeming as if she wept)
sayde.</p>

<p>Alas my good Neighbours, you see at what unfitting houres, this
bad man comes home to his house, after hee hath lyen in a Taverne all
day drunke, sleeping and snorting like a Swine. You are my honest witnesses,
how long I have suffered this beastlinesse in him, yet neyther
your good counsell, nor my too often loving admonitions, can worke
that good which wee have expected. Wherefore, to try if shame can
procure any amendment, I have shut him out of doores, until his drunken
fit be over-past, and so he shall stand to coole his feet.</p>

<p><i>Tofano</i> (but in very uncivill manner) told her being abroad that night,
and how she had used him: But the Neighbours seeing her to be within
the house, and beleeving her, rather then him, in regard of his too
wellknowne ill qualities; very sharpely reproved him, gave him grosse
speeches, pittying that any honest Woman should be so continually abused.
Now my good Neighbours (quoth she) you see what manner
of man he is. What would you thinke of me, if I should walk the streets
thus in the night time, or be so late out of mine owne house, as this dayly
Drunkard is? I was affraid least you would have given credit to his
dissembling speeches, when he told you, that I was at the Welles side,
and threw something into the Well: but that I know your better opinion
of me, and how sildome I am to be seene out of doores, although he
would induce your sharper judgement of me, and lay that shame upon
me, wherein he hath sinned himselfe.</p>

<p>The Neighbours, both men and Women, were all very severely incensed
against <i>Tofano</i>, condemning him for his great fault that night
committed, and avouching his wife to be vertuous and honest. Within
a little while, the noise passing from Neighbour to Neighbour, at the
length it came to the eares of her Kindred, who forthwith resorted thither,
and hearing how sharpely the Neighbours reprehended <i>Tofano</i>:
they tooke him, soundly bastanadoed him, and hardly left any bone of
him unbruised. Afterward, they went into the house, tooke all such
things thence as belonged to hir, taking hir also with them to their dwelling,
and threatning <i>Tofano</i> with further infliction of punishment, both
for his drunkennesse, and causlesse jealousie.</p>

<p><i>Tofano</i> perceyving how curstly they had handled him, and what crooked
meanes might further be used against him, in regard her Kindred &amp;
Friends were very mightie: thought it much better, patiently to suffer
the wrong alreadie done him, then by obstinate contending, to proceed
further, and fare worse. He became a suter to her Kindred, that al might
be forgotten and forgiven, in recompence whereof; he would not onely
refraine from drunkennesse, but also, never more be jelous of his wife.
This being faithfully promised, and <i>Cheta</i> reconciled to her Husband,
all strife was ended, she enjoyed her friends favour, as occasion served,
but yet with such discretion, as it was not noted. Thus the Coxcombe
foole, was faine to purchase his peace, after a notorious wrong
sustained, and further injuries to bee
offered.</p>

<h2>The fift Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>In just scorne and mockery of such jealous Husbands, that will be so idle headed
upon no occasion. And yet when they have good reason for it, do least
of all suspect any such injury.</i></h4>


<p>Madam <i>Lauretta</i> having ended her Novell, and every one commended
the Woman, for fitting <i>Tofano</i> in his kinde; and, as
his jealousie and drunkennesse justly deserved: the King (to
prevent all losse of time) turned to Madame <i>Fiammetta</i>, commaunding
her to follow next: whereuppon, very graciously, shee beganne in this
manner.</p>

<p>Noble Ladies, the precedent Novell delivered by Madame <i>Lauretta</i>,
maketh me willing to speake of another jealous man; as being halfe
perswaded, that whatsoever is done to them by their Wives, and especially
upon no occasion given, they doe no more then well becommeth
them. And if those grave heads, which were the first instituters of lawes,
had diligently observed all things; I am of the minde, that they would
have ordained no other penalty for Women, then they appointed against
such, as (in their owne defence) do offend any other. For jealous
husbands, are meere insidiators of their Wives lives, and most diligent
pursuers of their deaths, being lockt up in their houses all the Weeke
long, imployed in nothing but domesticke drudging affayres: which
makes them desirous of high Festivall dayes, to receive some little comfort
abroad, by an honest recreation or pastime, as Husbandmen in the
fields, Artizans in our Citie, or Governours in our judiciall Courtes;
yea, or as our Lord himselfe, who rested the seaventh day from all his
travailes. In like manner, it is so willed and ordained by the Lawes, as
well divine as humane, which have regard to the glory of God, and for
the common good of every one; making distinction betweene those
dayes appointed for labour, and the other determined for rest. Whereto
jealous persons (in no case) will give consent, but all those dayes
(which for other women are pleasing and delightfull) unto such, over
whom they command, are most irksome, sadde and sorrowful, because
then they are lockt up, and very strictly restrained. And if question were
urged, how many good women do live and consume away in this torturing
hell of affliction: I can make no other answere, but such as feele it,
are best able to discover it. Wherefore to conclude the proheme to my
present purpose, let none be over rash in condemning women: for what
they do to their husbands, being jealous without occasion; but rather
commend their wit and providence.</p>

<p>Somtime (faire Ladies) there lived in <i>Arimino</i>, a Merchant, very rich
in wealth and worldly possessions, who having a beautifull Gentlewoman
to his wife, he became extreamly jelous of her. And he had no other
reason for this foolish conceit; but, like as he loved hir dearly, and
found her to be very absolutely faire: even so he imagined, that although
she devised by her best meanes to give him content; yet others would
grow enamored of her, because she appeared so amiable to al. In which
respect, time might tutor her to affect some other beside himselfe: the
onely common argument of every bad minded man, being weake and
shallow in his owne understanding. This jelous humor increasing in him
more and more, he kept her in such narrow restraint: that many persons
condemned to death, have enjoyed larger libertie in their imprisonment.
For, she might not bee present at Feasts, Weddings, nor goe to
Church, or so much as to be seen at her doore: Nay, she durst not stand
in her Window, nor looke out of her house, for any occasion whatsoever.
By means whereof, life seemed most tedious and offensive to her,
and she supported it the more impatiently, because shee knew her selfe
not any way faulty.</p>

<p>Seeing her husband still persist in this shamefull course towards her;
she studied, how she might best comfort her selfe in this desolate case:
by devising some one meane or other (if any at all were to bee founde)
whereby he might be requited in his kind, and wear that badge of shame
whereof he was now but onely affraid. And because she could not gain
so small a permission, as to be seene at any window, where (happily) she
might have observed some one passing by in the street, discerning a little
parcell of her love: she remembred at length, that, in the next house to
her Husbands (they both joyning close together) there dwelt a comely
young proper Gentleman, whose perfections carried correspondencie
with her desires. She also considered with her selfe, that if there were any
partition wall; such a chinke or cranny might easily be made therein,
by which (at one time or other) she should gaine a sight of the young
Gentleman, and finde an houre so fitting, as to conferre with him, and
bestow her lovely favour on him, if he pleased to accept it. If successe (in
this case) proved answerable to her hope, then thus she resolved to outrun
the rest of her wearisome dayes, except the frensie of jealousie did finish
her husbands loathed life before.</p>

<p>Walking from one roome to another, thorough every part of the
house; and no wall escaping without diligent surveying; on a day, when
her Husband was absent from home, she espyed in a corner very secret,
an indifferent cleft in the Wall, which though it yeelded no full view on
the other side, yet she plainly perceived it to be an handsome Chamber,
and grew more then halfe perswaded, that either it might be the Chamber
of <i>Philippo</i> (for so was the neighbouring young Gentleman named) or
else a passage guiding thereto. A Chambermaid of hers, who compassioned
her case very much; made such observance, by her Mistresses direction,
that she found it to be <i>Philippoes</i> bed Chamber, and where alwayes
he used to lodge alone. By often visiting this rift or chinke in the
Wall, especially when the Gentleman was there; and by throwing in
little stones, flowers, and such like things, which fell still in his way as he
walked: so farre she prevailed, that he stepping to the chinke, to know
from whence they came; shee called softly to him, who knowing her
voyce, there they had such private conference together, as was not any
way displeasing to either. So that the chinke being made a little larger;
yet so, as it could not be easily discerned: their mouthes might meete
with kisses together, and their hands folded each in other; but nothing
else to be performed, for continuall feare of her jelous husband.</p>

<p>Now the Feast of Christmasse drawing neere, the Gentlewoman said
to her Husband; that, if it stood with his liking: she would do such duty
as fitted with so solemne a time, by going earely in a morning unto
Church, there to be confessed, and receive her Saviour, as other Christians
did. How now? replied the jealous Asse, what sinnes have you committed,
that should neede confession? How Husband? quoth she, what
do you thinke me to be a Saint? Who knoweth not, I pray you, that I
am as subject to sinne, as any other Woman living in the world? But
my sins are not to be revealed to you, because you are no Priest. These
words enflamed his jealousie more violently then before, and needes
must he know what sinnes she had committed, &amp; having resolved what
to do in this case, made her answer: That hee was contented with her
motion, alwaies provided, that she went to no other Church, then unto
their owne Chappel, betimes in a morning; and their own Chaplaine to
confesse her, or some other Priest by him appointed, but not any other:
and then she to returne home presently againe. She being a woman of
acute apprehension, presently collected his whole intention: but seeming
to take no knowledge thereof, replyed, that she would not swerve
from his direction.</p>

<p>When the appointed day was come, she arose very earely, and being
prepared answerable to her owne liking, to the Chappell shee went as
her Husband had appointed, where her jealous Husband (being much
earlier risen then she) attended for her comming: having so ordred the
matter with his Chaplaine, that he was cloathed in his Cowle, with a
large Hood hanging over his eyes, that she should not know him, and
so he went and sate downe in the Confessors place. Shee being entred
into the Chappell, and calling for the Priest to heare her confession, he
made her answer: that he could not intend it, but would bring her to
another holy Brother, who was at better leysure then hee. So to her
Husband he brought her, that seemed (in all respects) like the Confessor
himselfe: save onely his Hood was not so closely veyled, but shee
knew his beard, and said to her selfe. What a mad world is this, when
jealousie can metamorphose an ordinary man into a Priest? But, let me
alone with him, I meane to fit him with that which he lookes for.</p>

<p>So, appearing to have no knowledge at all of him, downe she fell at
his feete, and he had conveyed a few Cherry stones into his mouth, to
trouble his speech from her knowledge; for, in all things els, he thought
himselfe to be sufficiently fitted for her. In the course of her confession,
she declared, that she was married to a most wicked jealous Husband,
and with whom she lead a very hatefull life. Neverthelesse (quoth she)
I am indifferently even with him, for I am beloved of an Holie Fryar,
that every night commeth and lyeth with me. When the jealous Husband
heard this, it stabbed him like a dagger to the heart, and, but for
this greedy covetous desire to know more; he would faine have broke
off confession, and got him gone. But, perceiving that it was his wisest
course, he questioned further with his wife, saying: Why good Woman,
doth not your husband lodge with you? Yes Sir, quoth she. How
is it possible then (replyed the Husband) that the Friar can lodge there
with you too?</p>

<p>She, dissembling a farre fetcht sigh, thus answered. Reverend Sir, I
know not what skilfull Art the Fryar useth, but this I am sure, every
doore in our house will flye open to him, so soone as he doth but touch
it. Moreover, he told me, that when he commeth unto my Chamber
doore, he speaketh certaine words to himselfe, which immediately casteth
my Husband into a dead sleepe, and, understanding him to bee
thus sleepily entranced: he openeth the doore, entreth in, lieth downe
by me, and this every night he faileth not to do. The jealous Coxcomb
angerly scratching his head, and wishing his wife halfe hangd, said: Mistresse,
this is very badly done, for you should keepe your selfe from all
men, but your husband onely. That shall I never doe, answered shee,
because (indeed) I love him dearely. Why then (quoth our supposed
Confessor) I cannot give you any absolution. I am the more sory Sir,
said she, I came not hither to tell you any leasings, for if I could, yet I
would not, because it is not good to fable with such Saint-like men as
you are. You do therein (quoth hee) the better, and surely I am very
sory for you, because in this dangerous condition, it will bee the utter
losse of your soule: neverthelesse, both for your husbands sake and your
owne, I will take some paines, and use such especiall prayers in your
name, which may (perchance) greatly avayle you. And I purpose now
and then, to send you a Novice or young Clearke of mine, whom you
may safely acquaint with your minde, and signifie to me, by him, whether
they have done you good, or no: and if they prove helpefull, then
will we further proceed therein. Alas Sir, said she, never trouble your
selfe, in sending any body to our house; because, if my Husband should
know it, he is so extreamly jelous, as all the world cannot otherwise
perswade him, but that he commeth thither for no honest intent, and so
I shall live worse then now I do. Fear not that, good woman, quoth he,
but beleeve it certainly, that I will have such a care in this case, as your
Husband shall never speake thereof to you. If you can doe so Sir, sayde
she, proceed I pray you, and I am well contented.</p>

<p>Confession being thus ended, and she receiving such pennance as hee
appointed, she arose on her feete, and went to heare Masse; while our
jealous Woodcocke (testily puffing and blowing) put off his Religious
habite, returning home presently to his house, beating his braines al the
the way as he went, what meanes he might best devise, for the taking of
his wife and the Friar together, whereby to have them both severely
punished. His wife being come home from the Chappell, discerned by
her Husbands lookes, that he was like to keepe but a sory Christmasse:
yet he used his utmost industry, to conceale what he had done, &amp; which
she knew as well as himself. And he having fully resolved, to watch his
own street doore the next night ensuing in person, in expectation of the
Friars comming, saide to his Wife. I have occasion both to suppe and
lodge out of my house this night, wherefore see you the streete doore
to be surely made fast on the inside, and the doore at the middest of the
staires, as also your own Chamber doore, and then (in Gods name) get
you to bed. Whereto she answered, that all should be done as hee had
appointed.</p>

<p>Afterward, when she saw convenient time, she went to the chink in
the Wall, and making such a signe as shee was woont to doe: <i>Phillippo</i>
came thither, to whom she declared all her mornings affayres, &amp; what
directions her husband had given her. Furthermore she saide, certaine I
am, that he will not depart from the house, but sit and watch the doore
without, to take one that comes not heere. If therefore, you can climbe
over the house top, and get in at our gutter Window, you and I may
conferre more familiarly together. The young Gentleman being no
dullard, had his lesson quickly taught him; and when night was come,
<i>Geloso</i> (for so must wee tearme the Cocke-braind husband) armes himselfe
at all points, with a browne Bill in his hand, and so he sits to watch
his owne doore. His Wife had made fast all the doores, especially that
on the midst of the stayres, because he should not (by any means) come
to her Chamber; and so, when the houre served, the Gentleman adventured
over the house top, found the gutter Window, and the way conducting
him to her Chamber, where I leave them to their further amorous
conference.</p>

<p><i>Geloso</i>, more then halfe mad with anger, first, because hee had lost his
supper: next, having sitten almost all the night (which was extreamely
cold and windie) his Armour much molesting him, and yet he could see
no Friar come: when day drew neere, and hee ashamed to watch there
any longer; conveighed himselfe to some more convenient place, where
putting off his Armes, and seeming to come from the place of his Lodging;
about the ninth houre, he found his doore open, entred in, &amp; went
up the stayres, going to dinner with his Wife. Within a while after, according
as <i>Geloso</i> had ordred the businesse, a youth came thither, seeming
to be the Novice sent from the Confessor, and he being admitted
to speake with her, demanded, whether shee were troubled or molested
that night passed, as formerly she had bin, and whether the partie came
or no? The Woman, who knew well enough the Messenger (notwithstanding
all his formall disguise) made answer: That the party expected,
came not: but if hee had come, it was to no purpose; because her
minde was now otherwise altred, albeit she changed not a jote from her
amorous conclusion.</p>

<p>What should I now further say unto you? <i>Geloso</i> continued his watch
many nights afterward, as hoping to surprize the Friar at his entrance,
and his wife kept still her contented quarter, according as opportunitie
served. In the conclusion, <i>Geloso</i> being no longer able to endure his
bootlesse watching, nor some (more then ordinary) pleasing countenance
in his wife: one day demaunded of her (with a very stearne and
frowning brow) what secret sinnes shee had revealed to the ghostly Father,
upon the day of her shrift? The Woman replyed, that she would
not tell him, neyther was it a matter reasonable, or lawfull for her to
doe. Wicked Woman, answered <i>Geloso</i>: I knowe them all well enough,
even in despight of thee, and every word that thou spakest unto
him. But Huswife, now I must further know, what the Fryar is, with
whom you are so farre in love, and (by meanes of his enchantments) lyeth
with you every night; tell me what and who he is, or else I meane to
cut your throate.</p>

<p>The Woman immediately made answer, it was not true, that she was
in love with any Fryar. How? quoth <i>Geloso</i>, didst thou not thou confesse so
much to the Ghostly Father, the other day when thou wast at shrift? No
Sir, sayde she, but if I did, I am sure he would not disclose it to you, except
hee suffered you to bee there present, which is an Article beyonde
his dutie. But if it were so, then I confesse freely, that I did say so unto
him. Make an end then quickely Wife (quoth <i>Geloso</i>) and tell mee
who the Friar is. The Woman fell into a hearty laughter, saying. It liketh
me singularly well, when a wise man will suffer himselfe to be ledde
by a simple Woman, even as a Sheepe is to the slaughter, and by the
hornes. If once thou wast wise, that wisedome became utterly lost, when
thou felst into that divellish frensie of jealousie, without knowing anie
reason for it: for, by this beastlike and no manly humor, thou hast eclipsed
no meane part of my glory, and womanly reputation.</p>

<p>Doest thou imagine Husband, that if I were so blinded in the eyes of
my head, as thou art in them which should informe thine understanding;
I could have found out the Priest, that would needs bee my Confessor?
I knew thee Husband to be the man, and therefore I prepared
my wit accordingly, to fit thee with the foolish imagination which thou
soughtest for, and (indeed) gave it thee. For, if thou hadst beene wise,
as thou makest the world to beleeve by outward apparance, thou wouldest
never have expressed such a basenesse of minde, to borrow the coulour
of a sanctified cloake, thereby to undermine the secrets of thine
honest meaning Wife. Wherefore, to feede thee in thy fond suspition,
I was the more free in my Confession, and tolde thee truely, with
whom, and how heinously I had transgressed. Did I not tell thee, that
I loved a Fryar? And art not thou he whom I love, being a Fryar, and
my ghostly Father, though (to thine owne shame) thou madst thy selfe
so? I said moreover, that there is not any doore in our house, that can
keepe it selfe shut against him, but (when he pleaseth) he comes and lies
with me. Now tell me Husband, What doore in our house hath (at
any time) bin shut against thee, but they are freely thine owne, &amp; grant
thee entrance? Thou art the same Friar that confest me, and lieth every
night with me, and so often as thou sentst thy young Novice or Clearke
to me, as often did I truly returne thee word, when the same Fryar lay
with me. But (by jealousie) thou hast so lost thine understanding, that
thou wilt hardly beleeve all this.</p>

<p>Alas good man, like an armed Watchman, thou satst at thine owne
doore all a cold Winters night, perswading mee (poore silly credulous
woman) that, upon urgent occasions, thou must needs suppe and lodge
from home. Remember thy selfe therefore better heereafter, become a
true understanding man, as thou shouldst bee, and make not thy selfe a
mocking stocke to them, who knoweth thy jealous qualities, as well as
I do, and be not so watchfull over me, as thou art. For I sweare by my
true honesty, that if I were but as willing, as thou art suspitious: I could
deceive thee, if thou hadst an hundred eyes, as Nature affords thee but
two, and have my pleasures freely, yet thou be not a jot the wiser, or my
credit any way impaired.</p>

<p>Our wonderfull wise <i>Geloso</i>, who (very advisedly considred) that he
had wholly heard his wives secret confession, and dreamed now on no
other doubt beside, but (perceiving by her speeches) how hee was become
a scorne to al men: without returning other answer, confirmed his
wife to bee both wise and honest, and now when he hadde just occasion
to be jealous indeede, hee utterly forsware it, and counted them all
Coxcombes that would be so misguided. Wherefore, she having thus
wisely wonne the way to her owne desires, and he reduced into a more
humane temper: I hope there was no more neede, of clambring over
houses in the night time like Cats, nor walking in at gutter Windowes,
but all abuses were honestly reformed.</p>

<h4><a name="Madame_Isabella_delighting_in_the_company_of_her_affected_Friend_named" id="Madame_Isabella_delighting_in_the_company_of_her_affected_Friend_named"><i>Madame</i> Isabella, <i>delighting in the company of her affected Friend, named</i>
Lionello, <i>and she being likewise beloved by</i> Signior Lambertuccio: <i>At
the same time as shee had entertained</i> Lionello, <i>shee was also visited by</i>
Lambertuccio. <i>Her Husband returning home in the very instant: shee
caused</i> Lambertuccio <i>to run forth with a drawne sword in his hand, and
(by that meanes) made an excuse sufficient for</i> Lionello <i>to her husband.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Sixth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is manifestly discerned, that if Love be driven to a narrow straite in
any of his attempts, yet hee can accomplish his purpose by some other supply.</i></h4>


<p>Wondrously pleasing to all the company, was the reported Novell
of Madame <i>Fiammetta</i>, every one applauding the Womans
wisedome, and that she had done no more, then as the
jealous foole her husband justly deserved. But shee having ended, the
King gave order unto Madame <i>Pampinea</i>, that now it was her turne to
speake, whereupon, thus she began. There are no meane store of people
who say (though very false and foolishly,) that Love maketh many to
be out of their wits, and that such as fall in Love, do utterly loose their
understanding. To mee this appeareth a very ydle opinion, as already
hath beene approved by the related discourses, and shall also bee made
manifest by another of mine owne.</p>

<p>In our City of <i>Florence</i>, famous for some good, though as many bad
qualities, there dwelt (not long since) a Gentlewoman, endued with
choice beauty and admirable perfections, being wife to Signior <i>Beltramo</i>,
a very valiant Knight, and a man of great possessions. As oftentimes
it commeth to passe, that a man cannot alwayes feede on one kind
of bread, but his appetite will be longing after change: so fared it with
this Lady, named <i>Isabella</i>, she being not satisfied with the delights of her
Husband; grew enamoured of a young Gentleman, called <i>Lionello</i>,
compleate of person and commendable qualities, albeit not of the fairest
fortunes, yet his affection every way sutable to hers. And full well you
know (faire Ladies) that where the mindes irreciprocally accorded, no
dilligence wanteth for the desires execution: so this amorous couple,
made many solemne protestations, untill they should bee friended by
opportunity.</p>

<p>It fortuned in the time of their hopefull expectation a Knight, named
Signior <i>Lambertuccio</i>, fell likewise in love with <i>Isabella</i>: but because
he was somewhat unsightly of person, and utterly unpleasing in the eye,
she grew regardlesse of his frequent solicitings, and would not accept either
tokens, or letters. Which when hee saw, (being very rich and of
great power) hee sought to compasse his intent by a contrary course,
threatning her with scandall and disgrace to her reputation, and with his
associates to bandie against her best friends. She knowing what manner
of man he was, and how able to abuse any with infamous imputations,
wisely returned him hopefull promises, though never meaning to
performe any, but onely (Lady-like) to flatter and foole him therewith.</p>

<p>Some few miles distant from <i>Florence, Beltramo</i> had a Castle of pleasure,
and there his Lady <i>Isabella</i> used to live all Summer, as all other doe
the like, being so possessed. On a day, <i>Beltramo</i> being ridden from
home, and she having sent for <i>Lionello</i>, to take the advantage of her Husbands
absence; accordingly he went, not doubting but to winne what
he had long expected. Signior <i>Lambertuccio</i> on the other side, meeting
<i>Beltramo</i> riding from his Castle, and <i>Isabella</i> now fit to enjoy his company:
gallops thither with all possible speede, because hee would bee no
longer delayed. Scarcely was <i>Lionello</i> entred the Castle, and receiving
directions by the waiting woman, to her Ladies Chamber: but <i>Lambertuccio</i>
gallopped in at the Gate, which the woman perceiving,
ranne presently and acquainted her Lady with the comming of <i>Lambertuccio</i>.</p>

<p>Now was shee the onely sorrowfull woman of the world; for nothing
was now to bee feared, but stormes and tempests, because
<i>Lambertuccio</i>, spake no other, then Lightning and Thunder,
and <i>Lionello</i>, (being no lesse affraide then shee) by her perswasion
crept behind the bed, where he hid himselfe very contentedly. By this
time <i>Lambertuccio</i> was dismounted from his Courser, which he fastened
(by the bridle) to a ring in the wall, and then the waiting woman came
to him, to guide him to her Lady and Mistresse: who stood ready at
the staires head, graced him with a very acceptable welcome, yet marvelling
much at his so sodaine comming. Lady (quoth he) I met your
Husband upon the way, which granting mine accesse to see you; I come
to claime your long delayed promise, the time being now so favourable
for it.</p>

<p>Before he had uttered halfe these words, <i>Beltramo</i>, having forgot an
especiall evidence in his Study, which was the onely occasion of his
journey, came gallopping backe againe into the Castell Court, and seeing
such a goodly Gelding stand fastened there, could not readily imagine
who was the owner thereof. The waiting woman, upon the sight
of her Masters entring into the Court, came to her Lady, saying: My
Master <i>Beltramo</i> is returned backe, newly alighted, and (questionlesse)
comming up the staires. Now was our Lady <i>Isabella</i>, ten times worse
affrighted then before, (having two severall amourous suters in her
house, both hoping, neither speeding, yet her credite lying at the stake
for either) by this unexpected returne of her Husband. Moreover,
there was no possible meanes, for the concealing of Signior <i>Lambertuccio</i>,
because his Gelding stood in the open Court, and therefore made
a shrewde presumption against her, upon the least doubtfull question
urged.</p>

<p>Neverthelesse, as womens wits are alwayes best upon sudden constraints,
looking forth of her window, and espying her Husband preparing
to come up: she threw her selfe on her day Couch, speaking thus
(earnestly) to <i>Lambertuccio</i>. Sir, if ever you loved mee, and would have
me faithfully to beleeve it, by the instant safety both of your owne honour,
and my life, doe but as I advise you. Forth draw your Sword,
and, with a stearne countenance, threatning death and destruction: run
downe the staires, and when you are beneath, say. I sweare by my best
fortunes, although I misse of thee now heere, yet I will be sure to finde
thee some where else. And if my Husband offer to stay you, or moove
any question to you: make no other answere, but what you formerly
spake in fury. Beside, so soone as you are mounted on horsebacke,
have no further conference with him, upon any occasion
whatsoever; to prevent all suspition in him, of our future intendments.</p>

<p><i>Lambertuccio</i> sware many terrible oathes, to observe her directions in
every part, and having drawne forth his Sword, grasping it naked in his
hand, and setting worse lookes one the businesse, then ever nature gave
him, because he had spent so much labour in vaine; he failed not in a jot
of the Ladies injunction. <i>Beltramo</i> having commanded his horse to
safe custody, and meeting <i>Lambertuccio</i> discending downe the staires, so
armed, swearing, and most extreamely storming, wondring extraordinarily
as his threatning words, made offer to imbrace him, and understand
the reason of his distemper. <i>Lambertuccio</i> repulsing him rudely,
and setting foote in the stirrup, mounted on his Gelding, and spake nothing
else but this. I sweare by the fairest of all my fortunes, although
I misse of thee heere: yet I will be sure to find thee some where else, and
so he gallopped mainely away.</p>

<p>When <i>Beltramo</i> was come up into his wives Chamber, hee found her
cast downe upon her Couch, weeping, full of feare, and greatly discomforted;
wherefore he said unto her, What is hee that Signior <i>Lambertuccio</i>
is so extreamely offended withall, and threatneth in such implacable
manner? The Lady arising from her Couch, and going neere to the
Beds, because <i>Lionello</i> might the better heare her; returned her Husband
this answere. Husband (quoth she) never was I so dreadfully affrighted
till now; for, a young Gentleman, of whence, or what he is, I know not,
came running into our Castle for rescue, being pursued by Signior <i>Lambertuccio</i>;
with a weapon ready drawne in his hand. Ascending up our stayres,
by what fortune, I know not, he found my chamber doore standing open, finding
me also working on my Sampler, and in wonderfull feare and trembling.</p>

<p>Good Madame (quoth hee) for Gods sake helpe to save my life, or else
I shall be slaine heere in your Chamber. Hearing his pittious cry, and compassionating
his desperate case; I arose from my worke, and in my demaunding
of whence, and what he was, that durst presume so boldly into my bed-chamber:
presently came up Signior <i>Lambertuccio</i> also, in the same uncivill
sorte, as before I tolde you, swaggering and swearing, where is this traiterous
villaine? Heereupon, I stept (somewhat stoutly) to my Chamber doore,
and as hee offered to enter, with a womans courage I resisted him, which
made him so much enraged against mee, that when hee saw mee to debarre
his entrance; after many terrible and vile oathes and vowes, hee ranne
downe the stayres againe, in such like manner as you chaunced to meete
him.</p>

<p>Now trust mee deare wife (said <i>Beltramo</i>) you behaved your selfe
very well and worthily: for, it would have beene a most notorious scandall
to us, if a man should bee slaine in your bed-chamber: and Signior
<i>Lambertuccio</i> carryed himselfe most dishonestly, to pursue any man so
outragiously, having taken my Castle as his Sanctuary. But alas wife,
what is become of the poore affrighted Gentleman? Introth Sir (quoth
she) I know not, but (somewhere or other) heereabout hee is hidden.
Where art thou honest friend? said plaine meaning <i>Beltramo</i>; Come
forth and feare not, for thine enemy is gone.</p>

<p><i>Lionello</i>, who had heard all the fore-passed discourse, which shee
had delivered to her Husband <i>Beltramo</i>, came creeping forth amazedly
(as one now very fearefully affrighted indeede) from under the further
side of the bedde, and <i>Beltramo</i> saide to him, What a quarrell was
this, between thee and furious <i>Lambertuccio</i>? Not any at all Sir, replyed
<i>Lionello</i>, to my knowledge, which verily perswadeth me; that either he
is not well in his wits, or else he mistaketh me for some other; because,
so soone as he saw me on the way, somewhat neere to this your Castle,
he drew forth his Sword, and swearing an horrible oath, said. Traitor
thou art a dead man. Upon these rough words, I stayed not to question
the occasion of mine offending him: but fled from him so fast as possibly
I could; but confesse my selfe (indeede) over-bold, by presuming
into your Ladies bed chamber, which yet (equalled with her mercie)
hath bin the onely meanes at this time, of saving my life.</p>

<p>She hath done like a good Lady, answered <i>Beltramo</i>, and I do verie
much commend her for it. But, recollect thy dismayed spirits together,
for I will see thee safely secured hence, afterward, looke to thy
selfe so well as thou canst. Dinner being immediately made ready, and
they having merrily feasted together: he bestowed a good Gelding on
<i>Lionello</i>, and rode along with him to <i>Florence</i>, where he left him quietly
in his owne lodging. The selfe-same Evening (according as <i>Isabella</i>
had given enstruction) <i>Lionello</i> conferred with <i>Lambertuccio</i>: and such
an agreement passed betweene them, that though some rough speeches
were noised abroad, to set the better colour on the businesse; yet al matters
were so cleanly carried, that <i>Beltramo</i> never knew this queint deceitfull
policy of his Wife.</p>

<h2>The Seventh Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Whereby is declared, that such as keepe many honest seeming servants, may
sometime finde a knave among them, and one that proves to be over-sawcy
with his Master.</i></h4>


<p>This so sodaine dexterity of wit in <i>Isabella</i>, related in verie modest
manner by Madame <i>Pampinea</i>, was not onely admired
by all the company; but likewise passed with as generall approbation.
But yet Madam <i>Philomena</i> (whom the King had commanded
next to succeede) peremptorily sayde. Worthy Ladies, if I am
not deceived; I intend to tell you another Tale presently; as much to
be commended as the last.</p>

<p>You are to understand then, that it is no long while since, when there
dwelt in <i>Paris</i> a <i>Florentine</i> Gentleman, who falling into decay of his estate,
by over-bountifull expences; undertooke the degree of a Merchant,
and thrived so well by his trading, that he grew to great wealth,
having one onely sonne by his wife, named <i>Lodovico</i>. This Sonne, partaking
somewhat in his Fathers former height of minde, and no way inclineable
to deale in Merchandize, had no meaning to be a Shop-man,
and therefore accompanied the Gentlemen of <i>France</i>, in sundry services
for the King; among whom, by his singular good carriage and qualities,
he happened to be not meanly esteemed. While thus he continued
in the Court, it chanced, that certaine Knights, returning from
<i>Jerusalem</i>, having there visited the holy Sepulcher, and comming into
company where <i>Lodovico</i> was: much familiar discourse passed amongst
them, concerning the faire women of <i>France, England,</i> and other parts
of the world where they had bin, and what delicate beauties they had
seene.</p>

<p>One in the company constantly avouched, that of all the Women by
them so generally observed, there was not any comparable to the Wife
of <i>Egano de Galluzzi</i>, dwelling in <i>Bologna</i>, and her name Madam <i>Beatrix</i>,
reputed to be the onely faire woman of the world. Many of the rest
maintained as much, having bin at <i>Bologna</i>, and likewise seene her. <i>Lodovico</i>
hearing the woman to be so highly commended, and never (as
yet) feeling any thought of amorous inclination; became sodainely
toucht with an earnest desire of seeing her, and his minde could entertaine
no other matter, but onely of travailing thither to see her, yea, and
to continue there, if occasion so served. The reason for his journey urged
to his Father, was to visit <i>Jerusalem</i>, and the holy Sepulcher, which
with much difficulty, at length he obtained his leave.</p>

<p>Being on his journey towards <i>Bologna</i>, by the name of <i>Anichino</i>, and
not of <i>Lodovico</i>, and being there arrived; upon the day following, and
having understood the place of her abiding: it was his good happe, to
see the Lady at her Window; she appearing in his eye farre more faire,
then all reports had made her to be. Heereupon, his affection became
so enflamed to her, as he vowed, never to depart from <i>Bologna</i>, untill he
had obtained her love. And devising by what meanes he might effect
his hopes, he grew perswaded (setting all other attempts aside) that if he
could be entertained into her Husbands service, and undergo some businesse
in the house, time might tutor him to obtaine his desire. Having
given his attendants sufficient allowance, to spare his company, and take
no knowledge of him, selling his Horses also, and other notices which
might discover him: he grew into acquaintance with the Hoste of the
house where he lay, revealing an earnest desire in himselfe, to serve som
Lord or worthy Gentleman, if any were willing to give him entertainment.</p>

<p>Now beleeve me Sir (answered the Hoste) you seeme worthy to have a
good service indeede, and I know a Noble Gentleman of this Cittie, who is named
<i>Egano</i>: he wil (without all question) accept your offer, for hee keepeth
many men of verie good deserving, and you shall have my furtherance therein
so much as may be. As he promised, so he performed, and taking <i>Anichino</i>
with him unto <i>Egano</i>: so farre he prevailed by his friendly protestations,
and good opinion of the young Gentleman; that <i>Anichino</i>
was (without more ado) accepted into <i>Eganoes</i> service, then which, nothing
could be more pleasing to him. Now had he the benefit of dayly
beholding his hearts Mistresse, and so acceptable proved his service to
<i>Egano</i>, that he grew very farre in love with him: not undertaking any
affayres whatsoever, without the advice and direction of <i>Anichino</i>, so
that he reposed his most especiall trust in him, as a man altogether governed
by him.</p>

<p>It fortuned upon a day, that <i>Egano</i> being ridden to flye his Hawke at
the River, and <i>Anichino</i> remaining behinde at home, Madame <i>Beatrix</i>,
who (as yet) had taken no notice of <i>Anichinoes</i> love to her (albeit her
selfe, observing his fine carriage and commendable qualities, was
highly pleased to have so seeming a servant) called him to play at the
Chesse with her: and <i>Anichino</i>, coveting nothing more then to content
her, carried himselfe so dexteriously in the game, that he permitted hir
still to win, which was no little joy to her. When all the Gentle-women,
and other friends there present, as spectators to behold their play,
had taken their farewell, and were departed, leaving them all alone, yet
gaming still: <i>Anichino</i> breathing forth an intire sigh, Madame <i>Beatrix</i>
looking merrily on him, said. Tell me <i>Anichino</i>, art not thou angrie, to
see me win? It should appeare so by that solemne sigh. No truly Madame,
answered <i>Anichino</i>, a matter of farre greater moment, then losse
of infinite games at the Chesse, was the occasion why I sighed. I pray
thee (replyed the Lady) by the love thou bearest me, as being my Servant
(if any love at all remain in thee towards me) give me a reason for
that harty sigh.</p>

<p>When he heard himselfe so severely conjured, by the love he bare to
her, and loved none else in the world beside: he gave a farre more hart-sicke
sigh, then before. Then his Lady and Mistresse entreated him seriously,
to let her know the cause of those two deepe sighes: whereto
<i>Anichino</i> thus replyed. Madam, if I should tell you, I stand greatly in feare
of offending you: and when I have told you, I doubt your discovery thereof to
some other. Beleeve me <i>Anichino</i> (quoth she) therein thou neither canst, or
shalt offend me. Moreover, assure thy selfe, that I wil never disclose it to any
other, except I may do it with thy consent. Madame (saide hee) seeing you
have protested such a solemne promise to mee, I will reveale no meane secret
unto you.</p>

<p>So, with teares standing in his eyes, he told her what he was; where
he heard the first report of her singular perfections, and instantly becam
enamored of her, as the maine motive of his entring into her service.
Then, most humbly he entreated her, that if it might agree with her
good liking, she would be pleased to commisserate his case; and grace
him with her private favours. Or, if shee might not be so mercifull to
him; that yet she would vouchsafe, to let him live in the lowly condition
as he did, and thinke it a thankefull duty in him, onely to love her.
O singular sweetnesse, naturally living in faire feminine blood! How
justly art thou worthy of praise in the like occasions? Thou couldst never
be wonne by sighes and teares; but hearty imprecations have alwayes
prevailed with thee, making thee apt and easie to amorous desires.
If I had praises answerable to thy great and glorious deservings,
my voice should never faint, nor my pen waxe weary, in the due and
obsequious performance of them.</p>

<p>Madam <i>Beatrix</i>, well observing <i>Anichino</i> when he spake, and giving
credit to his so solemne protestations; they were so powerfull in prevailing
with her, that her senses (in the same manner) were enchanted; and
sighes flew as violently from her, as before he had vented them: which
stormy tempest being a little over-blowne, thus she spake. <i>Anichino</i>, my
hearts deere affected Friend, live in hope, for I tell thee truly, never could
gifts, promises, nor any Courtings used to me by Lords, Knights, Gentlemen,
or other (although I have bin solicited by many) winne the lest grace
or favour at my hand, no, nor move me to any affection. But thou, in a minute
of time (compared with their long and tedious suing) hast expressed
such a soveraigne potency in thy sweet words, that thou hast made me more
thine, then mine owne: and beleeve it unfeinedly, I hold thee to be worthy
of my love. Wherefore, with this kisse I freely give it thee, and make thee a
further promise, that before this night shall be fully past, thou shalt in better
manner perceive it. Adventure into my Chamber about the houre of
midnight, I will leave the doore open: thou knowest, on which side of the
bed I use to rest, come thither and feare not: if I sleep, the least gentle touch
of thy hand will wake me, and then thou shalt see how much I love thee. So,
with a kinde kisse or two, the bargaine was concluded, she licensing his
departure for that time, and he staying in hope of his hearts happinesse,
till when, he thought every houre a yeare.</p>

<p>In the meane while, <i>Egano</i> returned home from Hawking, and so
soone as he had supt (being very weary) he went to bed, and his Ladie
likewise with him, leaving her Chamber doore open, according as she
had promised. At the houre appointed, <i>Anichino</i> came, finding the
doore but easily put too, which (being entred) softly he closed againe,
in the same manner as he found it. Going to the beds side where the
Lady lay, and gently touching her brest with his hand, he found her to
be awake, and perceiving he was come according unto promise, shee
caught his hand fast with hers, and held him very strongly. Then, turning
(as she could) towards <i>Egano</i>, she made such meanes, as hee awaked,
whereupon she spake unto him as followeth.</p>

<p>Sir, yesternight I would have had a fewe speeches with you: but, in regard
of your wearinesse and early going to bed, I could not have any opportunity.
Now, this time and place being most convenient, I desire to bee resolved
by you: Among all the men retained into your service; which of them
you do thinke to be the best, most loyall, and worthiest to enjoy your love?
<i>Egano</i> answered thus: Wife, why should you move such a question to me? Do
not you know, that I never had any servant heeretofore, or ever shall have
heereafter, in whom I reposed the like trust as I have done, and do in <i>Anichino</i>?
But to what end is this motion of yours? I will tell you Sir (quoth
she) and then be Judge yourself, whether I have reason to move this question,
or no. Mine opinion every way equalled yours, concerning <i>Anichino</i>, &amp;
that he was more just and faithfull to you, then any could be amongest all
the rest: But Husband, like as where the water runneth stillest, the Foord
is deepest, even so, his smooth lookes have beguiled both you and me. For,
no longer agoe, then this verie day, no sooner were you ridden foorth on
Hauking, but he (belike purposely) tarrying at home, watching such a leysure
as best fitted his intent: was not ashamed to solicite mee, both to abuse
your bed, and mine owne spotlesse honour.</p>

<p>Moreover, he prosecuted his impious purpose with such alluring perswasions:
that being a weake woman, and not willing to endure over many Amorous
proofes (onely to acquaint you with his most sawcie immodestie,
and to revenge your selfe uppon him as best you may; your selfe beeing best
able to pronounce him guiltie) I made him promise, to meete him in our
Garden, presently after midde-night, and to finde mee sitting under the
Pine-Tree, never meaning (as I am vertuous) to be there. But, that you
may know the deceite and falshoode of your Servant, I would have you to
put on my Night-gowne, my head Attire, and Chinne-cloath, and sitting
but a short while there underneath the Pine-Tree: such is his insatiate
desire, as he will not faile to come, and then you may proceede, as you finde
occasion.</p>

<p>When <i>Egano</i> heard these Words, sodainely hee started out of Bed,
saying. Doe I foster such a Snake in mine owne bosome? Gramercie
Wife for this politicke promise of thine, and beleeve mee, I meane
to follow it effectually. So, on he put his Ladies Night-gown, her formall
head Attire and Chin-cloth, going presently downe into the Garden,
to expect <i>Anichinoes</i> comming to the Pine-Tree. But before the
matter grew to this issue, let me demand of you faire Ladies, in what a
lamentable condition (as you may imagine) was poore <i>Anichino</i>; to bee
so strongly detained by her, heare all his amorous suite discovered, and
likely to draw very heavy afflictions on him? Undoubtedly, he looked
for immediate apprehension by <i>Egano</i>, imprisonment and publike punishment
for his so malapert presumption: and had it proved so, she had
much renowned her selfe, and dealt with him but as he had justlie deserved.</p>

<p>But frailtie in our feminine sex is too much prevalent, and makes us
wander from vertuous courses, when we are wel onward in the way to
them. Madam <i>Beatrix</i>, whatsoever passed betweene her and <i>Anichino</i>, I
know not, but, either to continue this new begunne league for further
time, or, to be revenged on her husbands simplicity, in over-rashlie giving
credit to so smooth a ly; this was her advise to him. <i>Anichino</i> quoth
she, Take a good Cudgell in thy hand, then go into the Garden so farre as
the Pine; and there, as if formerly thou hadst solicited mee unto this secret
meeting, only but by way of approving my honestie: in my name, revile
thy master so bitterly as thou canst, bestowing manie sound blowes on him
with thy cudgel; yet urge the shame stil (as it were) to mee, and never leave
him, til thou hast beaten him out of the garden, to teach him keepe his bed
another time. Such an apt Scholler as <i>Anichino</i> was in this kind, needs no
tuturing, but a word is enough to a ready Wit. To the Garden goes
he, with a good willow cudgell in his hand, and comming neere to the
Pine-tree, there he found <i>Egano</i> disguised like to his Lady, who arising
from the place where he sate, went with chearefull gesture to welcome
him; but <i>Anichino</i> (in rough and stearne manner) thus spake unto him.
Wicked, shamelesse, and most immodest Woman, Art thou come, according
to thine unchaste and lascivious promise? Couldest thou so easily credite,
(though I tempted thee, to trie the vertue of thy continencie) I would offer
such a damnable wrong to my worthy Master, that so deerely loves me, and
reposeth his especiall confidence in me? Thou art much deceived in me, and
shalt finde, that I hate to be false to him.</p>

<p>So lifting up the Cudgell, he gave him therewith halfe a score good
bastinadoes, laying them on soundly, both on his armes and shoulders:
and <i>Egano</i> feeling the smart of them, durst not speake one Worde, but
fled away from him so fast as hee could, <i>Anichino</i> still following, and
multiplying many other injurious speeches against him, with the Epithites
of Strumpet, lustfull and insatiate Woman. Go thou lewde beast
(quoth he) most unworthy the title of a Lady, or to be Wife unto so good a
natured man, as my Mayster is, to whom I will reveale thy most ungracious
incivility to Morrow, that he may punish thee a little better then I have
done.</p>

<p><i>Egano</i> being thus well beaten for his Garden walke, got within the
doore, and so went up to his Chamber againe: his Lady there demanding
of him, whether <i>Anichino</i> came according to his promise, or no?
Come? quoth Egano, Yes Wife, he came, but deerely to my cost: for hee verily
taking me for thee, hath beaten me most extreamly, calling me an hundred
Whores and Strumpets, reputing thee to bee the wickedest Woman living.
In good sadnesse <i>Beatrix</i>, I wondred not a little at him, that he would
give thee any such vile speeches, with intent to wrong mee in mine honour.
Questionlesse, because hee saw thee to be joviall spirited, gracious and affable
towardes all men; therefore hee intended to make triall of thine honest
carriage. Well Sir (sayde shee) twas happy that hee tempted mee with
words, and let you taste the proofe of them by deeds: and let him thinke,
that I brooke those words as distastably, as you do or can, his ill deeds. But
seeing he is so just, faithfull, and loyall to you, you may love him the better,
and respect him as you finde occasion.</p>

<p>Whereto <i>Egano</i> thus replyed. Now trust me wife, thou hast said very
well: And drawing hence the argument of his setled perswasion; that
he had the chastest Woman living to his wife, and so just a Servant, as
could not be fellowed: there never was any further discoverie of this
Garden-night accident. Perhaps, Madame <i>Beatrix</i> and <i>Anichino</i> might
subtilly smile thereat in secret, in regard that they knew more then any
other else beside did. But, as for honest meaning <i>Egano</i>, hee never
had so much as the verie least mistrust of ill dealing, either in his
Lady, or <i>Anichino</i>; whom hee loved and esteemed farre more respectively
uppon this proofe of his honestie towards him, then hee would
or could possibly have done, without a triall so playne and pregnant.</p>

<h2>The Eight Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Whereby appeareth, that an Husband ought to be very well advised, when
he meaneth to discover any wrong offered his wife; except hee himselfe
do rashly run into all the shame and reproach.</i></h4>


<p>It seemed to the whole assembly, that Madam <i>Beatrix</i>, dealte
somewhat strangely, in the manner of beguiling her husband;
and affirmed also, that <i>Anichino</i> had great cause of fear, when
she held him so strongly by her beds side, and related all his amorous
temptation. But when the King perceyved, that Madame <i>Philomena</i>
sate silent, he turned to Madam <i>Neiphila</i>, willing her to supply the next
place; who modestly smiling, thus began.</p>

<p>Faire Ladies, it were an heavy burthen imposed on me, and a matter
much surmounting my capacity, if I should vainely imagine, to content
you with so pleasing a Novell, as those have already done, by you so
singularly reported: neverthelesse, I must discharge my dutie, and take
my fortune as it fals, albeit I hope to finde you mercifull.</p>

<p>You are to know then, that sometime there lived in our Citie, a very
welthy Merchant, named <i>Arriguccio Berlinghieri</i>, who (as many Merchants
have done) fondly imagined, to make himselfe a Gentleman by
marriage. Which that he might the more assuredly do, he took to wife
a Gentlewoman, one much above his degree or element, she being named
<i>Simonida</i>. Now, in regard that he delighted (as it is the usuall life
of a Merchant) to be often abroad, and little at home, whereby shee
had small benefit of his company; shee grew very forward in affection
with a young Gentleman, called Signior <i>Roberto</i>, who had solicited hir
by many amorous meanes, and (at length) prevailed to win her favor.
Which favour being once obtained; affection gaddes so farre beyond al
discretion, and makes Lovers so heedelesse of their private conversations:
that either they are taken tardy in their folly, or else subjected to
scandalous suspition.</p>

<p>It came to passe, that <i>Arriguccio</i>, either by rumour, or some other
more sensible apprehension, had received such intelligence concerning
his Wife <i>Simonida</i>, as he grew into extraordinarie jealousie of her, refraining
travaile abroad, as formerly he was wont to doe, and ceassing
from his verie ordinary affayres, addicting all his care and endeavour,
onely to be watchfull of his Wife; so that he never durst sleepe, untill
she were by him in the bed, which was no meane molestation to her,
being thus curbd from her familiar meetings with <i>Roberto</i>. Neverthelesse,
having a long while consulted with her wittes, to find some apte
meanes for conversing with him, being thereto also very earnestlie still
solicited by him; you shall heare what course she undertooke.</p>

<p>Her Chamber being on the streete side, and somewhat juttying over
it, she observed the disposition of her Husband, that every night it was
long before he fell asleepe: but beeing once falne into it, no noyse
whatsoever, could easily wake him. This his solemne and sound sleeping,
emboldned her so farre, as to meete with <i>Roberto</i> at the streete
doore, which (while her Husband slept) softly she would open to him,
and there in private converse with him.</p>

<p>But, because shee would know the certaine houre of his comming,
without the least suspition of any: she hung a thred forth of her Chamber
Window, descending downe, within the compasse of <i>Robertoes</i>
reach in the street, and the other end thereof, guided from the Window
to the bed, being conveyed under the cloathes, and shee being in
bed, she fastned it about her left great Toe, wherewith <i>Roberto</i> was sufficiently
acquainted, and thus enstructed withall; that at his comming,
he should plucke the thred, &amp; if her husband was in his dead sleep, she
would let go the thred, and come downe to him: but if he slept not, she
would hold it strongly, and then his tarrying would prove but in vaine;
there could be no meeting that night.</p>

<p>This devise was highly pleasing both to <i>Roberto</i> and <i>Simonida</i>, being
the intelligencer of their often meeting, and many times also advising
the contrary. But in the end, as the quaintest cunning may faile at
one time or another; so it fortuned one night, that <i>Simonida</i> being in a
sound sleepe, and <i>Arriguccio</i> waking, because his drowsie houre was
not as yet come: as he extended forth his legge in the bed, he found the
thred, which feeling in his hand, and perceiving it was tyed to his wives
great toe; it prooved apt tinder to kindle further Jealousie, and now hee
suspected some treachery indeede, and so much the rather because the
thred guided (under the cloathes) from the bed to the window, and there
hanging downe into the streete, as a warning to some further businesse.</p>

<p>Now was <i>Arriguccio</i> so furiously enflamed, that hee must needes bee
further resolved in this apparant doubt: and because therein hee would
not be deceived, softly he cut the thred from his wives toe, and made it
fast about his owne; to trye what successe would ensue thereon. It was
not long before <i>Roberto</i> came, and according as hee used to doe, hee
pluckt the thred, which <i>Arriguccio</i> felt, but because hee had not tyed it
fast, and <i>Roberto</i> pulling it over-hardly, it fell downe from the window
into his hand, which he understood as his lesson, to attend her comming,
and so hee did. <i>Arriguccio</i> stealing softly out of bed from his wife, and
taking his Sword under his arme, went downe to the doore, to see who
it was, with full intent of further revenge. Now, albeit he was a Merchant,
yet he wanted not courage, and boldnesse of spirit, and opening
the doore without any noyse, onely as his wife was wont to doe: <i>Roberto</i>,
there waiting his entrance, perceived by the doores unfashionable opening,
that it was not <i>Simonida</i>, but her Husband, whereupon he betooke
himselfe to flight, and <i>Arriguccio</i> fiercely followed him. At the
length, <i>Roberto</i> perceiving that flight avayled him not, because his enemy
still pursued him: being armed also with a Sword, as <i>Arriguccio</i>
was; he returned backe upon him, the one offering to offend, as the other
stood upon his defence, and so in the darke they fought together.</p>

<p><i>Simonida</i> awaking, even when her Husband went foorth of the
Chamber, and finding the thred to be cut from her toe; conjectured
immediately, that her subtle cunning was discovered, and supposing
her Husband in pursuite of <i>Roberto</i>, presently she arose; and, considering
what was likely to ensue thereon, called her Chamber-maide (who
was not ignorant in the businesse) and by perswasions prevailed so with
her, that she lay downe in her place in the bed, upon solemne protestations
and liberall promises, not to make her selfe knowne, but to suffer all
patiently, either blowes, or other ill usage of her Husband, which shee
would recompence in such bountifull sort, as she should have no occasion
to complaine. So, putting out the watch-light, which every night
burned in the Chamber, she departed thence, and sate downe in a close
corner of the house, to see what would be the end of all this stirre, after
her Husbands comming home.</p>

<p>The fight (as you have formerly heard) continuing betweene <i>Roberto</i>
and <i>Arriguccio</i>, the neighbours hearing of the clashing of their Swords
in the streets; arose out of their beds, and reproved them in very harsh
manner. In which respect <i>Arriguccio</i>, fearing to be knowne, and ignorant
also what his adversary was (no harme being as yet done on either
side) permitted him to depart; and extreamely full of anger, returned
backe againe to his house. Being come up into his bed-chamber, Thus
he began; Where is this lewde and wicked woman? what? hast thou put
out the light, because I should not finde thee? that shall not avayle thee,
for I can well enough finde a drab in the darke. So, groping on to the
beds side, and thinking hee had taken hold on his wife, he grasped the
Chamber-maide, so beating her with his fists, and spurning her with his
feet, that all her face was bloody &amp; bruised. Next, with his knife he cut off
a great deal of her haire: giving her the most villanous speeches as could
be devised: swearing, that he would make her a shame to all the world.</p>

<p>You need make no doubt, but the poore maide wept exceedingly, as
she had good occasion to doe: and albeit many times she desired mercy,
and that hee would not bee so cruell to her: yet notwithstanding, her
voyce was so broken with crying, and his impacience so extreame, that
rage hindered all power of distinguishing, or knowing his wives tongue
from a strangers. Having thus madly beaten her, and cut the lockes off
from her head, thus he spake to her. Wicked woman, and no wife of mine,
be sure I have not done with thee yet; for, although I meane not now to beate
thee any longer: I will goe to thy brethren, and they shall understand thy
dishonest behaviour. Then will I bring them home with me, and they perceiving
how much thou hast abused both their honour and thine owne; let
them deale with thee as they finde occasion, for thou art no more a companion
for me. No sooner had he uttered these angry words, but hee went
forth of the Chamber, bolting it fast on the outward side, as meaning to
keepe her safely inclosed, &amp; out of the house he went alone by himselfe.</p>

<p><i>Simonida</i>, who had heard all this tempestuous conflict, perceiving
that her Husband had lockt the streete doore after him, and was gone
whether he pleased: unbolted the Chamber doore, lighted a waxe candle,
and went in to see her poore maide, whom she found to be most pittifully
misused. She comforted her as well as she could, brought her
into her owne lodging Chamber, where washing her face and hurts in
very soveraigne waters, and rewarding her liberally with <i>Arriguccioes</i>
owne Gold; she held her selfe to bee sufficiently satisfyed. So, leaving
the maide in her lodging, and returning againe to her owne Chamber:
she made up the bed in such former manner, as if no body had lodged
therein that night. Then hanging up her Lampe fresh fild with oyle, and
clearly lighted, she deckt her selfe in so decent sort, as if she had bin in no
bed all that night.</p>

<p>Then taking sowing worke in her hand, either shirts or bands of her
Husbands; hanging the Lampe by her, and sitting downe at the stayres
head, she fell to worke in very serious manner, as if shee had undertaken
some imposed taske.</p>

<p>On the other side, <i>Arriguccio</i> had travelled so farre from his house,
till he came at last to the dwelling of <i>Simonidaes</i> brethren: where hee
knockt so soundly, that he was quickely heard, and (almost as speedily)
let in. <i>Simonidaes</i> brethren, and her mother also, hearing of <i>Arriguccioes</i>
comming thither so late. Rose from their beds, and each of them
having a Waxe Candle lighted came presently to him, to understand
the cause of this his so unseasonable visitation. <i>Arriguccio</i>, beginning at
the originall of the matter, the thred found tyed about his wives great
toe, the fight and houshold conflict after following: related every circumstance
to them. And for the better proofe of his words, he shewed
them the thred it selfe, the lockes supposed of his wives haire, and adding
withall; that they might now dispose of <i>Simonida</i> as themselves
pleased, because she should remaine no longer in his house.</p>

<p>The brethren to <i>Simonida</i> were exceedingly offended at this relation,
in regard they beleeved it for truth, and in this fury, commanded Torches
to be lighted, preparing to part thence with <i>Arriguccio</i> home to his
house, for the more sharpe reprehension of their Sister. Which when
their mother saw, she followed them weeping, first entreating one, and
then the other, not to be over rash in crediting such a slander, but rather
to consider the truth thereof advisedly: because the Husband might be
angry with his Wife upon some other occasion, and having outraged
her, made this the meanes in excuse of himselfe. Moreover she said, that
she could not chuse but wonder greatly, how this matter should thus
come to passe; because she had good knowledge of her daughter, during
the whole course of her education, faultlesse and blamelesse in every
degree; with many other good words of her beside, as proceeding from
naturall affection of a mother.</p>

<p>Being come to the house of <i>Arriguccio</i>, entring in, and ascending up
the stayres: they heard <i>Simonida</i> sweetly singing at her working; but
pausing, upon hearing their rude trampling, shee demaunded, who was
there. One of the angry brethren presently answered: Lewde woman
as thou art, thou shalt know soone enough who is heere: Our blessed Lady
be with us (quoth <i>Simonida</i>) and sweet Saint Frances helpe to defend me,
who dare use such unseemely speeches? Starting up and meeting them on
the staire head: Kinde brethren, (said she) is it you? What, and my loving
mother too? For sweet Saint Charities sake, what may be the reason of your
comming hither in this manner. Shee being set downe againe to her
worke, so neatly apparelled, without any signe of outrage offered her,
her face unblemished, her haire comely ordered, and differing wholly
from the former speeches of her Husband: the Brethren marvelled
thereat not a little; and asswaging somewhat the impetuous torrent of
their rage; began to demaund in coole blood, (as it were) from what
ground her Husbands complaints proceeded, and threatning her
roughly, if she would not confesse the truth intirely to them.</p>

<p>Ave Maria (quoth <i>Simonida</i>, crossing her selfe) Alas deare Brethren,
I know not what you say, or meane, nor wherein my Husband should bee offended,
or make any complaint at all of me. <i>Arriguccio</i> hearing this, looked
on her like a man that had lost his Senses: for well he remembred,
how many cruell blowes he had given her on the face, beside scratches
of his nailes, and spurnes of his feet, as also the cutting of her haire, the
the least shew of all which misusage, was not now to be seene. Her brethren
likewise briefly told her, the whole effect of her Husbands speeches,
shewing her the thred, and in what cruell manner he sware hee did
beate her. <i>Simonida</i>, turning then to her Husband, and seeming as confounded
with amazement, said. How is this Husband? what doe I heare?
would you have me supposed (to your owne shame and disgrace) to be a bad
woman, and your selfe a cruell curst man, when (on either side) there is no
such matter? When were you this night heere in the house with mee? Or
when should you beate mee, and I not feele nor know it. Beleeve me (sweete
heart) all these are meerely miracles to me.</p>

<p>Now was <i>Arriguccio</i> ten times more mad in his minde, then before,
saying. Divell, and no woman, did wee not this night goe both together to
bed? Did not I cut this thred from thy great toe, tyed it to mine, and found
the craftie compact betweene thee and thy Minnion? Did not I follow and
fight with him in the streets? Came I not backe againe, and beate thee as
a Strumpet should be? And are not these the locks of haire, which I my
selfe did cut from thy head?</p>

<p>Alas Sir (quoth she) where have you been? doe you know what you say?
you did not lodge in this house this night, neither did I see you all the whole
day and night, till now.</p>

<p>But leaving this, and come to the matter now in question, because I
have no other testimony then mine owne words. You say, that you
did beate me, and cut those lockes of haire from my head. Alas Sir, why
should you slander your selfe? In all your life time you did never strike
me. And to approve the truth of my speeches, doe you your selfe, and
all else heere present, looke on me advisedly, if any signe of blow or beating
is to be seene on me. Nor were it an easie matter for you to doe
either to smite, or so much as lay your hand (in anger) on me, it would
cost dearer then you thinke for. And whereas you say, that you did
cut those lockes of haire from my head; it is more then either I know, or
felt, nor are they in colour like to mine: but, because my Mother and brethren
shall be my witnesses therein, and whether you did it without my
knowledge; you shall all see, if they be cut, or no. So, taking off her
head attyre, she displayed her hayre over her shoulders, which had suffered
no violence, neither seemed to bee so much as uncivilly or rudely
handled.</p>

<p>When the mother and brethren saw this, they began to murmure against
<i>Arriguccio</i>, saying, What thinke you of this Sir? you tell us of
strange matters which you have done, and all proving false, we wonder how
you can make good the rest. <i>Arriguccio</i> looked wilde, and confusedly,
striving still to maintaine his accusation: but seeing every thing to bee
flatly against him, he durst not attempt to speake one word. <i>Simonida</i>
tooke advantage of this distraction in him, and turning to her brethren,
saide. I see now the marke whereat he aymeth, to make me doe what I never
meante: Namely, that I should acquaint you with his vile qualities, and
what a wretched life I leade with him, which seeing hee will needes have
me to reveale; beare with me if I doe it upon compulsion.</p>

<p>Mother and Brethren, I am verily perswaded, that those accidents which
he disclosed to you, hath doubtlesse (in the same manner) happened to him,
and you shall heare how. Very true it is, that this seeming honest man, to
whom (in a lucklesse houre) you married me, stileth himselfe by the name
of a Merchant, coveting to be so accounted and credited, as holy in outward
appearance, as a Religious Monke, and as demure in lookes, as the modestest
Maide: like a notorious common drunkard, is a Taverne hunter, where
making his luxurius matches, one while with one Whore, then againe with
another; hee causeth mee every night to sit tarrying for him, even in the
same sort as you found me: sometimes till midnight, and otherwhiles till
broad day light in the morning.</p>

<p>And questionlesse, being in his wounted drunken humour, hee hath lyen
with one of his sweet Consorts, about whose toe he found the thred, and finding
her as false to him, as he hath alwayes been to me: Did not onely beat
her, but also cut the haire from her head. And having not yet recovered
his sences, is verily perswaded, and cannot be altered from it; but that hee
performed all this villany to me. And if you doe but advisedly observe his
countenance, he appeareth yet to be more then halfe drunke.</p>

<p>But whatsoever he hath said concerning me, I make no account at all
thereof, because he spake it in his drunkennesse, and as freely as I forgive
him, even so (good Mother and kinde Brethren) let mee entreate you to do
the like.</p>

<p>When the Mother had heard these words, and confidently beleeved
her Daughter: she began to torment her selfe with anger, saying. By the
faith of my body Daughter, this unkindnesse is not be endured, but rather
let the dogge be hanged, that his qualities may be knowne, he being utterly
unworthy, to have so good a woman to his wife, as thou art. What could he
have done more, if he had taken thee in the open streete, and in company of
some wanton Gallants? In an unfortunate houre wast thou married to him,
base jealous Coxecombe as he is, and it is quite against sense, or reason, that
thou shouldest be subject to his fooleries. What was hee, but a Merchant of
Eale-skinnes or Orenges; bred in some paltry countrey village; taken from
Hogge-rubbing; clothed in Sheepes-Sattin, with Clownish Startops, Leather
stockings, and Caddies garters: His whole habite not worth three
shillings: And yet he must have a faire Gentlewoman to his Wife, of honest
fame, riches and reputation; when, comparing his pedegree with hers, hee
is farre unfit to wipe her shooes.</p>

<p>Oh my deare Sonnes, I would you had followed my counsell, and permitted
her to match in the honourable family of <i>Count Guido</i>, which was
much mooved, and seriously pursued. But you would needs bestow her on
this goodly Jewell; who, although shee is one of the choysest beauties in
Florence, chaste, honest and truely vertuous: Is not ashamed at midnight,
to proclaime her for a common whore, as if we had no better knowledge
of her. But by the blessed mother of Saint <i>John</i>, if you would be ruled
by mine advise; our law should make him dearely smart for it.</p>

<p>Alas my sonnes, did I not tell you at home in our owne house, that his
words were no way likely to prove true? Have not your eyes observed his
unmannerly behaviour to your Sister? If I were as you are, hearing what
he hath said, and noting his drunken carriage beside; I should never give over,
as long as he had any life left in him. And were I a man, as I am a
woman; none other then my selfe should revenge her wrongs, making him
a publike spectacle to all drabbing drunkards.</p>

<p>When the brethren had heard and observed all these occurrences;
in most bitter manner they railed on <i>Arriguccio</i>, bestowing some good
bastinadoes on him beside, concluding thus with him in the end. Quoth
one of them, Wee will pardon this shamefull abusing of our Sister, because
thou art a notorious drunkard: but looke to it (on perill of thy life) that
we have no more such newes hereafter; for, beleeve it unfainedly, if any
such impudent rumours happen to our eares, or so much as a flying fame
thereof; thou shalt surely be paide for both faults together.</p>

<p>So home againe went they, and <i>Arriguccio</i> stood like one that had
neither life or motion, not knowing (whether what he had done) was
true, or no, or if he dreamed all this while, and so (without uttering any
word) he left his Wife, and went quietly to bed. Thus by her wisdome,
she did not onely prevent an imminent perill: but also made a free and
open passage, to further contentment with her amourous friend, yet
dreadlesse of any distaste or suspition in her Husband.</p>

<i>Governour of</i> Argos, <i>falling in love with a Gentleman, named</i> Pyrrhus;
<i>was requested by him (as a true testimony of her unfeigned affection)
to performe three severall actions of her selfe. She did accomplish them
all, and imbraced and kissed</i> Pyrrhus <i>in the presence of</i> Nicostratus; <i>by
perswading him, that whatsoever he saw, was meerely false.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Ninth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is declared, that great Lords may sometime be deceived by their
Wives, as well as men of meaner condition.</i></h4>


<p>The Novell delivered, by Madame <i>Neiphila</i> seemed so pleasing
to all the Ladies; as they could not refraine from hearty laughter,
beside much liberality of speech. Albeit the King did oftentimes
urge silence, and commanded <i>Pamphilus</i> to follow next. So, when
attention was admitted, <i>Pamphilus</i> began in this order. I am of opinion,
faire Ladies, that there is not any matter, how uneasie or doubtfull
soever it may seeme to be; but the man or woman that affecteth fervently,
dare boldly attempt, and effectually accomplish. And this perswasion
of mine, although it hath beene sufficiently approved, by many
of our passed Novels: Yet notwithstanding, I shall make it much
apparent to you, by a present discourse of mine owne. Wherein I
have occasion to speake of a Lady, to whom Fortune was more favourable,
then either reason or judgement, could give direction. In
which regard, I would not advise any of you, to entertaine so high an
imagination of minde, as to tracke her footsteps of whom I am now to
speake: because Fortune containeth not alwayes one and the same disposition,
neither can all mens eyes be blinded after one manner. And so
proceed we to our Tale.</p>

<p>In <i>Argos</i>, a most ancient Citie of <i>Achaya</i>, much more renowned by
her precedent Kings, then wealth, or any other great matter of worth:
there lived as Lieutenant or Governour thereof, a Noble Lord, named
<i>Nicostratus</i>, on whom (albeit hee was well stept into yeares) Fortune
bestowed in a marriage a great Lady, no lesse bold of spirit, then choisely
beautifull. <i>Nicostratus</i>, abounding in treasure and wealthy possessions,
kept a goodly trains of Servants, Horses, Houndes, Hawkes, and
what else not, as having an extraordinary felicity in all kinds of game, as
singular exercises to maintaine his health.</p>

<p>Among his other Servants and Followers, there was a young Gentleman,
gracefull of person, excellent in speech, and every way as active
as no man could be more: his name <i>Pyrrhus</i>, highly affected of <i>Nicostratus</i>,
and more intimately trusted then all the rest. Such seemed the
perfections of this <i>Pyrrhus</i>, that <i>Lydia</i> (for so was the Lady named) began
to affect him very earnestly, and in such sort, as day or night shee
could take no rest, but devised all meanes to compasse her harts desire.
Now, whether he observed this inclination of her towards him, or else
would take no notice thereof, it could not be discerned by any outward
apprehension: which moved the more impatiency in her, &amp; drove her
hopes to dispairing passions. Wherein to finde some comfort and ease,
she called an ancient Gentlewoman of her Chamber, in whom shee reposed
especiall confidence, and thus she spake to her.</p>

<p><i>Lesca</i>, The good turnes and favours thou hast received from me, should
make thee faithfull and obedient to me: and therefore set a locke uppon thy
lippes, for revealing to any one whatsoever, such matters as now I shall impart
to thee; except it be to him that I command thee. Thou perceivest <i>Lesca</i>,
how youthfull I am, apt to all sprightly recreations, rich, and abounding
in all that a woman can wish to have, in regard of Fortunes common &amp; ordinary
favours: yet I have one especiall cause of complaint: namely, the inequality
of my Mariage, my Husband being over-ancient for me; in which
regard, my youth finds it selfe too highly wronged, being defeated of those
duties and delights, which women (farre inferiour to me) are continuallie
cloyed withall, and I am utterly deprived of. I am subject to the same desires
they are, and deserve to taste the benefit of them, in as ample manner,
as they do or can.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have lived with the losse of time, which yet (in some measure)
may be releeved and recompenced: For, though Fortune were mine enemy
in Mariage, by such a disproportion of our conditions: yet she may befriend
in another nature, and kindely redeeme the injury done me. Wherefore <i>Lesca</i>,
to be as compleate in this case, as I am in all the rest beside; I have resolved
upon a private Friend, and one more worthy then any other; Namely,
my Servant <i>Pyrrhus</i>, whose youth carieth some correspondency with mine;
and so constantly have I setled my love to him, as I am not well, but when I
thinke on him, or see him: and (indeede) shall dye, except the sooner I may
enjoy him. And therefore, if my life and well-fare be respected by thee, let
him understand the integrity of mine affection, by such good means as thou
findest it most expedient to be done: entreating him from me, that I may
have some conference with him, when he shall thereto be solicited by me.</p>

<p>The Chamber-Gentlewoman <i>Lesca</i>, willingly undertooke the Ladies
Embassie; and so soone as opportunity did favor her: having withdrawne
<i>Pyrrhus</i> into an apt and commodious place, shee delivered the
Message to him, in the best manner she could devise. Which <i>Pyrrhus</i>
hearing, did not a little wonder thereat, never having noted any such
matter; and therefore sodainly conceyved, that the Lady did this onely
to try him; whereupon, somewhat roundly and roughly, hee returned
this answere. <i>Lesca</i>, I am not so simple, as to credite any such Message to
be sent from my Lady, and therefore be better advised of thy words. But admit
that it should come from her, yet I cannot be perswaded, that her soule
consented to such harsh Language, far differing from a forme so full of beauty.
And yet admit againe, that her hart and tongue herein were relatives:
My Lord and Master hath so farre honoured mee, and so much beyond the
least part of merite in mee: as I will rather dye, then any way offer to disgrace
him: And therefore I charge thee, never more to move mee in this
matter.</p>

<p><i>Lesca</i>, not a jot danted at his stearne words, presently she saide. <i>Pyrrhus</i>,
Both in this and all other Messages my Lady shall command me, I wil
speake to thee whensoever shee pleaseth, receive what discontent thou canst
thereby; or make presumption of what doubts thou maist devise. But as I
found thee a senselesse fellow, dull, and not shaped to any understanding, so I
leave thee: And in that anger parted from him, carrying backe the same
answer to her Lady. She no sooner heard it, but instantly shee wished
her selfe to be dead; and within some few dayes after, she conferred againe
with her Chamber-woman, saying. <i>Lesca</i>, thou knowest well enough,
that the Oxe falleth not at the first blow of the Axe, neither is
the victory won, upon a silly and shallow adventure: Wherefore, I
thinke it convenient, that once more thou shouldst make another tryall
of him, who (in prejudice to me) standeth so strictly on his loyalty, and
choosing such an houre as seemeth most commodious, soundly possesse
him with my tormenting passions. Bestirre thy Wittes, and tippe thy
tongue with a Womans eloquence, to effect what I so earnestly desire:
because, by languishing in this love-sicke affliction, it well bee the danger
of my death, and some severe detriment to him, to be the occasion
of so great a losse.</p>

<p><i>Lesca</i>, comforted her Lady, so much as lay in her power to doe, and
having sought for <i>Pyrrhus</i>, whom she found at good leysure; and, in a
pleasing humor, thus she beganne. <i>Pyrrhus</i>, some few dayes since I tolde
thee, in what extreame Agonies thy Lady and mine was, onely in regarde
of her love to thee: and now againe I come once more, to give thee further
assurance thereof: Wherefore, beleeve it unfeignedly, that if thy obstinacie
continue still, in like manner as the other day it did, expect very shortly
to heare the tydings of her death.</p>

<p>It is my part therefore, to entreat thee, to comfort her long languishing
desires: but if thou persist in thy harsh opinion, in stead of reputing thee a
wise and fortunate young man, I shall confesse thee to bee an ignoraunt Asse.
What a glorie is it to thee, to be affected of so faire and worthy a Lady, beyond
all men else whatsoever? Next to this, tell me, how highly maist thou
confesse thy selfe beholding to Fortune, if thou but duly consider, how shee
hath elected thee as sole soveraigne of her hopes, which is a crowne of honour
to thy youth, and a sufficient refuge against all wants and necessities?
Where is any to thy knowledge like thy selfe, that can make such advantage
of his time, as thou maist do, if thou wert wise? Where canst thou find any
one to go beyond thee in Armes, Horses, sumptuous garments, and Gold, as
will be heaped on thee, if <i>Lydia</i> may be the Lady of thy love? Open then
thine understanding to my words, returne into thine owne soule, and bee
wise for thy selfe.</p>

<p>Remember (<i>Pyrrhus</i>) that Fortune presents her selfe but once before any
one, with cheerefull lookes, and her lappe wide open of richest favours,
where if choice be not quickely made, before she folde it up, and turn her
backe: let no complaint afterward be made of her, if the Fellow that had
so faire an offer, proove to be miserable, wretched, and a Beggar, only thorow
his owne negligence. Beside, what else hath formerly bin saide, there
is now no such neede of loyaltie in servants to their Ladies, as should be among
deare Friends and Kindred: but servants ought rather (as best they
may) be such to their Masters, as they are to them. Doest thou imagine,
that if thou hadst a faire Wife, Mother, Daughter, or Sister, pleasing in
the eye of our <i>Nicostratus</i>; he would stand on such nice tearmes of duty or
Loyaltie, as now thou doest to his Ladie? Thou wert a verie foole to rest
so perswaded. Assure thy selfe, that if entreaties and faire meanes might
not prevaile, force, and compulsion (whatsoever ensued thereon) woulde
winne the masterie. Let us then use them, and the commodities unto them
belonging, as they would us and ours. Use the benefit of thy Fortune, &amp;
beware of abusing her favour. She yet smiles on thee; but take heede least
she turne her backe, it will then be over-late to repent thy folly. And if my
Ladie die through thy disdaine, be assured, that thou canst not escape with
life, beside open shame and disgrace for ever.</p>

<p><i>Pyrrhus</i>, who had often considered on <i>Lescaes</i> first message, concluded
with himselfe; that if any more she moved the same matter: hee
would returne her another kinde of answere, wholly yeelding to content
his Lady; provided, that he might remaine assured, concerning the
intyre truth of the motion, and that it was not urged onely to trie him,
wherefore, thus he replyed. <i>Lesca</i>, do not imagine mee so ignorant, as
not to know the certaintie of all thy former allegations, confessing them as
freely as thou doest, or canst. But yet let mee tell thee withall, that I knowe
my Lord to be wise and judicious, and having committed all his affaires to
my care and trust: never blame mee to misdoubt; least my Ladie (by his
counsell and advice) make thee the messenger of this motion, thereby to call
my Fidelitie in question.</p>

<p>To cleare which doubt, and for my further assurance of her well meaning
toward me; if she wil undertake the performance of three such things
as I must needes require in this case: I am afterward her owne, in any service
she can command me. The first of them, is, that in the presence of my
Lord and Master, she kill his faire Faulcon, which so dearly hee affecteth.
The second, to send me a locke or tuft of his beard, being puld away with
her owne hand. The third and last, with the same hand also, to pluck out
one of his best and soundest teeth, and send it mee as her loves true token.
When I finde all these three effectually performed, I am wholly hers, &amp; not
before.</p>

<p>These three strict impositions, seemed to <i>Lesca</i>, and her Ladie likewise,
almost beyond the compasse of all possibility. Nevertheles Love,
being a powerfull Oratour in perswading, as also adventurous even on
the most difficult dangers; gave her courage to undertake them all: sending
<i>Lesca</i> backe againe to him, with full assurance, of these more then
<i>Herculean</i> labours. Moreover, her selfe did intend to adde a fourth
taske, in regard of his strong opinion concerning the great Wisedome
of his Lord and Maister. After she had effected all the other three, she
would not permit him to kisse her, but before his Lords face: which
yet should be accomplished in such sort, as <i>Nicostratus</i> himselfe should
not beleeve it, although apparantly he saw it. Well, (quoth <i>Pyrrhus</i>)
when all these wonders are performed, assure my Ladie, that I am truelie
hers.</p>

<p>Within a short while after, <i>Nicostratus</i> made a solemne Feastivall (according
as yearely he used to doe) in honour of his birth day, inviting
many Lords and Ladies thereto. On which rejoycing day, so soone as
dinner was ended, and the Tables withdrawne: <i>Lydia</i> came into the
great Hall, where the Feast was solemnly kept; very rich and costly apparrelled;
and there, in presence of <i>Pyrrhus</i>, and the whole assemblie,
going to the Perch whereon the Faulcone sate, wherein her Husband
tooke no little delight, and having untyed her, as if shee meant to beare
her on her Fist: tooke her by the Jesses, and beating her against the wal,
killed her. <i>Nicostratus</i> beholding this, called out aloud unto her, saying.
Alas Madame! what have you done? She making him no answere,
but turning to the Lords and Ladies, which had dined there, spake in
this manner.</p>

<p>Ill should I take revenge on a King, that had offended me, if I had not so
much heart, as to wreake my spleene on a paltry Hawke. Understand then,
worthy Lords and Ladies, that this Faulcone hath long time robbed me of
those delights, which men (in meere equitie) ought to have with their
wives: because continually, so soone as breake of day hath appeared, my
Husband, starting out of bed, makes himselfe readie, presently to Horsse,
and with this Faulcon on his Fist, rides abroad to his recreation in the
Fields. And I, in such forsaken sort as you see, am left all alone in my bed,
discontented and despised: often vowing to my selfe, to bee thus revenged
as now I am, being with-held from it by no other occasion, but onely want
of a fit and apt time, to do it in the presence of such persons, as might bee
just Judges of my wrongs, and as I conceive you all to be.</p>

<p>The Lords and Ladies hearing these words, and beleeving this deed
of hers to be done no otherwise, but out of her entire affection to <i>Nicostratus</i>,
according as her speeches sounded: compassionately turning towards
him (who was exceedingly displeased) and all smiling, said. Now
in good sadnesse Sir; Madame <i>Lydia</i> hath done well, in acting her just revenge
upon the Hawke, that bereft her of her Husbands kinde companie;
then which nothing is more precious to a loving wife, and a hell it is to live
without it. And <i>Lydia</i>, being sodainly withdrawne into her chamber;
with much other friendly and familiar talke, they converted the anger
of <i>Nicostratus</i> into mirth and smiling.</p>

<p><i>Pyrrhus</i>, who had diligently observed the whole carriage of this businesse,
saide to himselfe. My Ladie hath begun well, and proceeding on
with no worse successe, will (no doubt) bring her love to an happy conclusion.
As for the Lady her selfe, she having thus kild the Hawke, it was
no long while after, but being in the Chamber with her husband, and
they conversing familiarly together: she began to jest with him, &amp; hee
in the like manner with her, tickling and toying each the other, till at
the length she played with his beard, and now she found occasion aptly
serving, to effect the second taske imposed by <i>Pyrrhus</i>. So, taking
fast hold on a small tuft of his beard, she gave a sodaine snatch, and plucked
it away quite from his chin. Whereat <i>Nicostratus</i> beeing angerly
moved, she (to appease his distaste) pleasantly thus spake. How now my
Lord? Why do you looke so frowningly? What? Are you angry for a few
loose haires of your beard? How then should I take it, when you plucke mee
by the haire of my head, and yet I am not a jot discontented, because I know
you do it but in jesting manner? These friendly speeches cut off all further
contention, and she kepte charily the tuft of her Husbands beard,
which (the verie selfe-same day) shee sent to <i>Pyrrhus</i> her hearts chosen
friend.</p>

<p>But now concerning the third matter to be adventured, it drove her
to a much more serious consideration, then those two which shee had
already so well and exactly performed. Notwithstanding, like a Ladie
of unconquerable spirit, and (in whom) Love enlarged his power more
and more: she sodainly conceited, what course was best to bee kept in
this case, forming her attempt in this manner. Upon <i>Nicostratus</i> wayted
two young Gentlemen, as Pages of his Chamber, whose Fathers
had given them to his service, to learne the manners of honourable
Courtship, and those qualities necessarily required in Gentlemen. One
of them, when <i>Nicostratus</i> sate downe to dinner or supper, stood in Office
of his Carver, delivering him all the meats whereon he fed. The
other (as Taster) attended on his Cup, and he dranke no other drinke,
but what hee brought him, and they both were highly pleasing unto
him.</p>

<p>On a day, <i>Lydia</i> called these two youths aside; and, among some other
speeches, which served but as an induction to her intended policy;
she perswaded them, that their mouths yeelded an unsavoury &amp; ill-pleasing
smell, whereof their Lord seemed to take dislike. Wherefore she
advised them, that at such times as they attended on him in their severall
places: they should (so much as possibly they could) withdraw their
heads aside from him, because their breath might not be noyous unto
him. But withall, to have an especiall care, of not disclosing to any one,
what she had told them; because (out of meere love) she had acquainted
them therewith: which very constantly they beleeved, and followed
the same direction as she had advised, being loath to displease, where
service bound them to obey. Choosing a time fitting for her purpose,
when <i>Nicostratus</i> was in private conference with her, thus she began.
Sir, you observe not the behaviour of your two pages, when they wait
on you at the Table? Yes but I do wife (quoth he) how squemishly they turn
their heads aside from me, and it hath often bin in my minde, to understand
a reason why they do so.</p>

<p>Seating herselfe by him, as if shee had some weighty matter to tell
him; she proceeded in this manner. Alas my Lord, you shall not need to
question them, because I can sufficiently resolve you therein: which (neverthelesse)
I have long concealed, because I would not be offensive to you.
But in regard, it is now manifestly apparant, that others have tasted, what
(I immagined) none but my selfe did, I will no longer hide it from you.
Assuredly Sir, there is a most strange and unwonted ill-savour, continually
issuing from your mouth, smelling most noysomely, and I wonder what
should be the occasion. In former times, I never felt any such foule breathing
to come from you: and you, who do daily converse with so many worthy
persons, should seeke meanes to be rid of so great an annoyance. You say
verie true wife (answered <i>Nicostratus</i>) and I protest to you on my Credite,
I feele no such ill smell, neither know what should cause it, except I have som
corrupted tooth in my mouth. Perhaps Sir (quoth she) it may be so, and
yet you feele not the savour which others do, yea, very offensively.</p>

<p>So, walking with her to a Window, he opened wide his mouth, the
which nicely shee surveyed on either side, and, turning her head from
him, as seeming unable to endure the savour: starting, and shrieking out
alowd, she said. Santa Maria! What a sight is this? Alas my good Lord,
How could you abide this, and for so long a while? Heere is a tooth on this
side, which (so farre as I can perceive) is not onely hollow and corrupted:
but also wholly putrified and rotten, and if it continue still in your head, beleeve
it for a truth, that it will infect and spoile all the rest neere it. I would
therefore counsell you, to let it be pluckt out, before it breede your further
danger. I like your counsell well <i>Lydia</i>, replyed <i>Nicostratus</i>, and presently
intend to follow it; Let therefore my Barber be sent for, and, without
any longer delay, he shall plucke it forth instantly.</p>

<p>How Sir? (quoth she,) your Barber? Uppon mine Honour, there shall
come no Barber heere. Why Sir, it is such a rotten Tooth, and standeth
so fairely for my hand: that, without helpe or advice of any Barber, let mee
alone for plucking it forth, without putting you to any paine at all. Moreover,
let me tell you Sir, those Tooth-drawers are so rude and cruell, in performing
such Offices, as my heart cannot endure, that you should come
within compasse of their currish courtesie, neither shall you Sir, if you will
be ruled by me. If I should faile in the manner of their facilitie, yet love &amp;
duty hath enstructed me, to forbeare your least paining, which no unmannerly
Barber will do.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, and he well contented with her kinde offer, the
instruments were brought, which are used in such occasions, all being
commanded forth of the Chamber, but onely <i>Lesca</i>, who evermore
kept still in her company. So, locking fast the doore, and <i>Nicostratus</i>
being seated, as she thought fittest for her purpose, she put the Tanacles
into his mouth, catching fast hold on one of his soundest teeth: which,
notwithstanding his loud crying, <i>Lesca</i> held him so strongly, that forth
she pluckt it, and hid it, having another tooth readie made hot &amp; bloody,
very much corrupted and rotten, which she helde in the Tanacles,
and shewed to him, who was well-neere halfe dead with anguish. See
Sir (quoth she) was this Tooth to be suffered in your head, and to yeeld so
foule a smell as it did? He verily beleeving what she said, albeit hee had
endured extreame paine, and still complained on her harsh and violent
pulling it out: rejoyced yet, that he was now ridde of it, and she comforting
him on the one side, and the anguish asswaging him on the other,
he departed forth of the Chamber.</p>

<p>In the mean while, by <i>Lesca</i> she sent the sound tooth to <i>Pyrrhus</i>, who
(wondering not a little at her so many strange attempts; which hee urged
so much the rather, as thinking their performance impossible, and,
in meere loyall duty to his Lord) seeing them all three to be notably effected;
he made no further doubt of her intire love towardes him, but
sent her assurance likewise, of his readinesse and serviceable diligence,
whensoever she would command him.</p>

<p>Now, after the passage of all these adventures, hardly to bee undertaken
by any other Woman: yet she held them insufficient for his security,
in the grounded perswasion of her love to him, except shee performed
another of her owne, and according as shee had boldly promised.
Houres do now seeme dayes, and dayes multiplicitie of yeeres, till the
kisse may be given, and receyved in the presence of <i>Nicostratus</i>, yet hee
himselfe to avouch the contrary.</p>

<p>Madam <i>Lydia</i> (upon a pretended sicknesse) keepeth her chamber, and
as women can hardly be exceeded in dissimulation: so, shee wanted no
wit, to seeme exquisitely cunning, in all the outwarde apparances of
sicknesse. One day after dinner, shee being visited by <i>Nicostratus</i>, and
none attending on him but <i>Pyrrhus</i> onely: she earnestly entreated, that
as a mitigation, to some inward afflictions which she felt, they would
helpe to guide her into the Garden.</p>

<p>Most gladly was her motion graunted, and <i>Nicostratus</i> gently taking
her by one arme, and <i>Pyrrhus</i> by the other, so they conducted her into
the Garden, seating her in a faire floury Grasse-plot, with her backe
leaning to a Peare-tree. Having sitten there an indifferent while, and
<i>Pyrrhus</i>, being formerly enstructed, in the directions which she had given
him, thus shee spake, some-what faintly. <i>Pyrrhus</i>, I have a kinde of
longing desire upon a sodaine, to taste of these Peares: Wherefore, climbe
up into the Tree, and cast me downe one or two; which instantly hee did.
Being aloft in the Tree, and throwing downe some of the best and ripest
Peares; at length (according to his premeditated Lesson) looking
downe, he said.</p>

<p>Forbeare my Lord, Do you not see, in how weake and feeble condition
my Ladie is, being shaken with so violent a sicknesse? And you Madam,
how kinde and loving soever you are to my Lord, Are you so little carefull
of your health, being but now come forth of your sicke Chamber, to be ruffled
and tumbled in such rough manner? Though such dalliances are not
amisse in you both; being fitter for the private Chamber, then an open garden,
and in the presence of a servant: yet time and place should alwaies bee
respectively considered, for the avoiding of ill example, and better testimonie
of your owne Wisedomes, which ever should be like your selves. But
if so soone, and even in the heate of a yet turbulent sickenesse, your equall
love can admit these kisses and embraces: your private Lodginges were
much more convenient, where no Servants eye can see such Wantonnesse,
nor you be reproved of indiscretion, for being too publique in your Familiaritie.</p>

<p>Madame <i>Lydia</i>, sodainely starting, and turning unto her Husband,
sayde. What doth <i>Pyrrhus</i> prate? Is he well in his wittes? Or is he franticke?
No Madame, replyed <i>Pyrrhus</i>, I am not franticke. Are you so fond
as to thinke that I do not see your folly? <i>Nicostratus</i> wondering at his
Words, presently answered. Now trust me <i>Pyrrhus</i>, I think thou dreamest.
No my Lord, replyed <i>Pyrrhus</i>, I dreame not a jot, neither do you,
or my Ladie: but if this Tree could affoord the like kindnesse to me, as you
do to her, there would not a Peare bee left uppon it. How now <i>Pyrrhus</i>?
(quoth <i>Lydia</i>) this language goeth beyond our understanding, it seemeth
thou knowest not what thou saist. Beleeve me husband, if I were as well as
ever I have bin, I would climb this tree, to see those idle wonders which hee
talketh of: for, while he continueth thus above, it appeareth, hee can finde
no other prattle, albeit he taketh his marke amisse.</p>

<p>Heereupon, he commanded <i>Pyrrhus</i> to come downe, and being on
the ground: Now <i>Pyrrhus</i> (quoth he) tell me what thou saydst. <i>Pyrrhus</i>,
pretending an alteration into much amazement, straungely looking about
him, saide; I know not verie well (my Lord) what answere I should
make you, fearing least my sight hath bin abused by error: for when I was
aloft in that Tree, it seemed manifestly to me: that you embraced my Lady
(though somewhat rudely, in regard of her perillous sicknesse, yet lovingly)
and as youthfully as in your younger daies, with infinite kisses, and wanton
dalliances, such as (indeede) deserved a far more private place in my poore
opinion. But in my descending downe, mee thought you gave over that amorous
familiaritie, and I found you seated as I left you. Now trust mee
<i>Pyrrhus</i>, answered <i>Nicostratus</i>, Thy tongue and wit have very strangely
wandred, both from reason and all reall apprehension: because we never stirred
from hence, since thou didst climbe up into the Tree, neither mooved otherwise,
then as now thou seest us. Alas my Lord (saide <i>Pyrrhus</i>) I humbly
crave pardon for my presumption, in reprooving you for meddling with
your owne: which shal make me hereafter better advised, in any thing what
soever I heare or see.</p>

<p>Mervaile and amazement, encreased in <i>Nicostratus</i> far greater then
before, hearing him to avouch still so constantly what he had seene, no
contradiction being able to alter him, which made him rashly sweare
and say. I will see my selfe, whether this Peare-tree bee enchanted, or no:
and such wonders to be seene when a man is up in it, as thou wouldst have
us to beleeve. And being mounted up so hy, that they were safe from his
sodaine comming on them, <i>Lydia</i> had soone forgotten her sicknes, and
the promised kisse cost her above twenty more, beside verie kinde and
hearty embraces, as lovingly respected and entertained by <i>Pyrrhus</i>.
Which <i>Nicostratus</i> beholding aloft in the tree; cryed out to her, saying.
Wicked woman, What doest thou meane? And thou villain <i>Pyrrhus</i>,
Darst thou abuse thy Lord, who hath reposed so much trust in thee? So,
descending in haste downe againe, yet crying so to them still: <i>Lydia</i>
replyed, Alas my Lord, Why do you raile and rave in such sort? So, hee
found her seated as before, and <i>Pyrrhus</i> waiting with dutifull reverence,
even as when he climbed up the Tree: but yet he thought his sight not
deceyved, for all their demure and formall behaviour, which made
him walke up and downe, extreamely fuming and fretting unto himselfe,
and which in some milder manner to qualifie, <i>Pyrrhus</i> spake thus
to him.</p>

<p>I deny not (my good Lord) but freely confesse, that even as your selfe, so
I, being above in the Tree, had my sight most falsely deluded: which is so
apparantly confirmed by you, and in the same sort, as there needeth no
doubt of both our beguiling; in one and the same suspitious nature. In which
case to be the more assuredly resolved, nothing can be questioned, but whether
your beleefe do so farre misleade you, as to thinke, that my Ladie (who
hath alwayes bene most wise, loyall, and vertuous,) would so shamefullie
wrong you: yea, and to performe it before your face, wherein I dare gadge
my life to the contrary. Concerning my selfe, it is not fit for mee, to argue
or contest in mine owne commendation: you that have ever knowne the sincerity
of my service, are best able to speake in my behalfe: and rather wold
I be drawne in peeces with foure wilde horses, then bee such an injurious
slave to my Lord and Master.</p>

<p>Now then, it can be no otherwise, but we must needs rest certainly perswaded,
that the guile and offence of this false appearance, was occasioned
by thee onely. For all the world could not make me otherwise beleeve, but
that I saw you kisse and most kindely imbrace my Lady: if your owne
eyes had not credited the like behaviour in me to her, of which sinne, I never
conceived so much as a thought. The Lady (on the other side) seeming
to be very angerly incensed, starting faintly upon her feet, yet supporting
her selfe by the tree, said. It appeareth Sir, that you have entertained
a goodly opinion of me as, if I were so lewde and lasciviously disposed,
or addicted to the very least desire of wantonnesse: that I would bee so
forgetfull of mine owne honour, as to adventure it in your sight, and with
a servant of my house? Oh Sir, such women as are so familiarly affected,
need learne no wit of men in amourous matters; their private Chambers
shall be better trusted, then an open blabing and tell-tale Garden.</p>

<p><i>Nicostratus</i>, who verily beleeved what they had both said, and that
neither of them would adventure such familiarity before his face: would
talke no more of the matter, but rather studyed of the rarity of such a
miracle, not seene, but in the height of the tree, and changing againe upon
the descent. But <i>Lydia</i>, containing still her colourable kinde of impatience,
and angerly frowning upon <i>Nicostratus</i>, stearnely saide. If I
may have my will, this villanous and deceiving tree, shall never more shame
me, or any other woman: and therefore <i>Pyrrhus</i>, runne for an Axe, and
by felling it to the ground, in an instant, revenge both thy wrong and mine.
Doest not thou serve a worthy Lord? And have not I a wise Husband, who,
without any consideration, will suffer the eye of his understanding to be so
dazeled, with a foolish imagination beyond all possibility? For, although his
eyes did apprehend such a folly, and it seemed to be a truth indeed: yet, in the
depth of setled judgement, all the world should not perswade him, that it
was so.</p>

<p><i>Pyrrhus</i> had quickely brought the Axe, and hewing downe the tree,
so soone as the Lady saw it fall; turning her selfe to <i>Nicostratus</i>, she said.
Now that I have seene mine honour and honesties enemy laid along; mine anger
is past, and Husband, I freely pardon you: intreating you heartily henceforward,
not to presume or imagine, that my love eyther is, or can bee altred
from you.</p>

<p>Thus the mocked and derided <i>Nicostratus</i>, returned in againe with his
Lady and <i>Pyrrhus</i>; where perhaps (although the Peare-tree was cut
downe) they could find as cunning meanes to over-reach him.</p>

according as he had formerly promised him to doe, and tolde him

<h2>The Tenth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein such men are covertly reprehended, who make no care or conscience
at all of those things that should preserve them from sinne.</i></h4>


<p>Now there remained none but the King himselfe, last of all to recount
his Novell; who, after hee heard the Ladies complaints
indifferently pacified, for the rash felling downe of such a precious
Peare-tree; thus he began. Faire Ladies, it is a case more then manifest,
that every King, who will be accounted just and upright: should first
of all, and rather then any other, observe those Lawes which he himselfe hath
made; otherwise he ought to be reputed as a servant, worthy of punishment,
and no King. Into which fault and reprehension, I your King, shall well neere
be constrained to fall; for yesterday I enacted a Law, upon the forme of our
discoursing, with full intent, that this day I would not use any part of my priviledge;
but being subject (as you all are) to the same Law, I should speake of
that argument, which already you have done.</p>

<p>Wherein, you have not onely performed more then I could wish, upon a subject
so sutable to my minde: but in every Novell, such variety of excellent
matter, such singular illustrations, and delicate eloquence hath flowne from
you all; as I am utterly unable to invent any thing (notwithstanding the most
curious search of my braine) apt or fit for the purpose, to paragon the meanest
of them already related. And therefore seeing I must needs sinne in the Law
established by my selfe; I tender my submission, as worthy of punishment, or
what amends else you please to enjoyne mee. Now, as returned to my wonted
priviledge, I say, that the Novell recounted by Madame <i>Eliza</i>, of the Fryar
Godfather and his Gossip <i>Agnesia</i>, as also the sottishnesse of the <i>Senese</i> her
Husband, hath wrought in me (worthy Ladies) to such effect; as, forbearing
to speake any more of these wily prancks, which witty wives exercise on their
simple Husbands; I am to tell you a pretty short Tale; which, though there is
matter enough in it, not worthy the crediting, yet partly it will bee pleasing to
heare.</p>

<p>Sometime there lived in <i>Sienna</i> two popular men; the one being named
<i>Tingoccio Mini</i> and the other <i>Meucio de Tora</i>; Men simple, and of
no understanding, both of them dwelling in <i>Porta Salaia</i>. These two men
lived in such familiar conversation together, and expressed such cordiall
affection each to other, as they seldome walked asunder; but (as honest
men use to doe) frequented Churches and Sermons, oftentimes hearing,
both what miseries and beatitudes were in the world to come, according
to the merits of their soules that were departed out of this life,
and found their equall repaiment in the other. The manifold repetition
of these matters, made them very earnestly desirous to know, by what
meanes they might have tydings from thence, for their further confirmation.
And finding all their endeavours utterly frustrated, they made
a solemne vow and promise (each to other under oath) that hee which
first dyed of them two, should returne backe againe (so soone as possibly
he could) to the other remaining alive, and tell him such tydings as hee
desired to heare.</p>

<p>After the promise was thus faithfully made, and they still keeping
company, as they were wont to doe: It fortuned, that <i>Tingoccio</i> became
Gossip to one, named <i>Ambrosito Anselmino</i>, dwelling in <i>Camporeggio</i>,
who by his wife, called <i>Monna Mita</i>, had a sweet and lovely Sonne. <i>Tingoccio</i>
often resorting thither, and consorted with his companion <i>Meucio</i>;
the she-Gossip, being a woman worthy the loving, faire and comely of
her person: <i>Tingoccio</i>, notwithstanding the Gossipship betweene them,
had more then a moneths minde to his Godchilds Mother. <i>Meucio</i> also
fell sicke of the same disease, because shee seemed pleasing in his eye,
and <i>Tingoccio</i> gave her no meane commendations; yet, carefully they
concealed their love to themselves, but not for one &amp; the same occasion.
Because <i>Tingoccio</i> kept it closely from <i>Meucio</i>, lest he should hold it disgracefull
in him, to beare amourous affection to his Gossip, and thought
it unfitting to bee knowne. But <i>Meucio</i> had no such meaning, for hee
knew well enough that <i>Tingoccio</i> loved her, and therefore conceived in
his minde, that if he discovered any such matter to him: He will (quoth
he) be jealous of me, and being her Gossip, which admitteth his conference
with her when himselfe pleaseth; he may easily make her to distaste
me, and therefore I must rest contented as I am.</p>

<p>Their love continuing on still in this kinde, <i>Tingoccio</i> prooved so fortunate
in the businesse, that having better meanes then his companion,
and more prevayling courses, when, where, and how to Court his Mistresse,
which seemed to forward him effectually. All which <i>Meucio</i>
plainely perceived, and though it was tedious and wearisome to him,
yet hoping to finde some successe at length: he would not take notice of
any thing, as fearing to infringe the amity betweene him and <i>Tingoccio</i>,
and so his hope to be quite supplanted. Thus the one triumphing in his
loves happinesse, and the other hoping for his felicity to come; a lingering
sickenesse seazed on <i>Tingoccio</i>, which brought him to so low a condition, as
at the length he dyed.</p>

<p>About some three or foure nights after, <i>Meucio</i> being fast asleepe in
his bed, the ghoste of <i>Tingoccio</i> appeared to him, and called so loude, that
<i>Meucio</i> awaking, demanded who called him? I am thy friend <i>Tingoccio</i>,
replied the ghoste, who according to my former promise made, am come
again in vision to thee, to tell thee tidings out of the nether world. <i>Meucio</i>
was a while somewhat amazed; but, recollecting his more manly
spirits together, boldly he said. My brother and friend, thou art heartily
welcome: but I thought thou hadst beene utterly lost. Those things (quoth
<i>Tingoccio</i>) are lost, which cannot be recovered againe, and if I were lost,
how could I then be heere with thee? Alas <i>Tingoccio</i>, replyed <i>Meucio</i>, my
meaning is not so: but I would be resolved, whether thou art among the
damned soules, in the painefull fire of hell torments, or no? No (quoth
<i>Tingoccio</i>) I am not sent thither, but for divers sinnes by mee committed
I am to suffer very great and grievous paines. Then <i>Meucio</i> demaunded
particularly, the punishments inflicted there, for the severall sinnes committed
heere: Wherein <i>Tingoccio</i> fully resolved him. And upon further
question, what hee would have to be done for him here, made answere,
That <i>Meucio</i> should cause Masses, Prayers and Almes deeds to
be performed for him, which (he said) were very helpefull to the soules
abiding there, and <i>Meucio</i> promised to see them done.</p>

<p>As the ghost was offering to depart, <i>Meucio</i> remembred <i>Tingoccioes</i>
Gossip <i>Monna Mita</i>, and raysing himselfe higher upon his pillowe, said.
My memorie informeth me, friend <i>Tingoccio</i>, of your kinde Gossip <i>Monna
Mita</i>, with whom (when you remained in this life) I knew you to be very
familiar: let me intreat you then to tell me, what punishment is inflicted
on you there, for that wanton sinne committed heere? Oh Brother <i>Meucio</i>,
answered <i>Tingoccio</i>, so soone as my soule was landed there, one came immediately
to me, who seemed to know all mine offences readily by heart, and
forthwith commanded, that I should depart thence into a certaine place,
where I must weepe for my sinnes in very grievous paines. There I found
more of my companions, condemned to the same punishment as I was, and
being among them, I called to minde some wanton dalliances, which had
passed betweene my Gossip and me, and expecting therefore farre greater afflictions,
then as yet I felt (although I was in a huge fire, and exceedingly
hot) yet with conceite of feare, I quaked and trembled wondrously.</p>

<p>One of my other Consorts being by me, and perceiving in what an extreame
agony I was; presently said unto me. My friend, what hast thou
done more, then any of us here condemned with thee, that thou tremblest
and quakest, being in so hot a fire? Oh my friend (quoth I) I am in feare
of a greater judgement then this, for a grievous offence by mee heretofore
committed while I lived. Then hee demaunded of mee what offence it
was, whereto thus I answered. It was my chance in the other world, to
be Godfather at a childs Christning, and afterward I grew so affectionate to
the childs mother, as (indeed) I kissed her twice or thrise. My companyon
laughing at me in mocking manner, replyed thus. Goe like an Asse as thou
art, and be no more affraid hereafter, for here is no punishment inflicted, in
any kinde whatsoever, for such offences of frailty committed, especially with
Gossips, as I my selfe can witnesse.</p>

<p>Now day drew on, and the Cockes began to crow, a dreadfull hearing
to walking spirits, when <i>Tingoccio</i> said to <i>Meucio</i>. Farewell my
friendly companion, for I may tarry no longer with thee, and instantly hee
vanished away. <i>Meucio</i> having heard this confession of his friend, and
verily beleeving it for a truth, that no punishment was to be inflicted in
the future world, for offences of frailty in this life, and chiefly with
Gossips: began to condemne his owne folly, having bin a Gossip to
many wives, yet modesty restrained him from such familiar offending.
And therefore being sorry for this grosse ignorance, hee made a vowe
to be wiser hereafter. And if Fryar <i>Reynard</i> had been acquainted with
this kind of shrift (as doubtlesse he was, though his Gossip <i>Agnesia</i> knew
it not) he needed no such Syllogismes, as he put in practise, when he converted
her to his lustfull knavery, in the comparison of kinred by him
moved, concerning her husband, the childe and himselfe. But, these are
the best fruits of such Fryerly Confessions, to compasse the issue of their
inordinate appetites; yet clouded with the cloake of Religion, which
hath beene the overthrow of too many.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By this time the gentle blast of <i>Zephirus</i> began to blow, because the
Sunne grew neere his setting, wherewith the King concluded his Novell,
and none remaining more to be thus imployed: taking the Crowne
from off his owne head, he placed it on Madame <i>Laurettaes</i>, saying, Madame,
I Crowne you with your owne Crowne, as Queene of our Company.
You shall henceforth command as Lady and Mistresse, in such occasions as
shall be to your liking, and for the contentment of us all; With which
words he set him downe. And Madame <i>Lauretta</i> being now created
Queene, shee caused the Master of the houshold to bee called, to whom
she gave command, that the Tables should be prepared in the pleasant
vally, but at a more convenient houre, then formerly had beene, because
they might (with better ease) returne backe to the Pallace. Then shee
tooke order likewise, for all such other necessary matters, as should bee
required in the time of her Regiment: and then turning her selfe to the
whole Company, she began in this manner.</p>

<p>It was the Will of <i>Dioneus</i> yesternight, that our discourses for this day,
should concerne the deceits of wives to their Husbands. And were it not
to avoyde taxation, of a spleenitive desire to be revenged, like the dog being
bitten, biteth againe: I could command our to morrows conference, to touch
mens treacheries towards their wives. But because I am free from any such
fiery humor, let it be your generall consideration, to speake of such queint beguylings,
as have heretofore past, either of the woman to the man, the man
to the woman, or of one man to another: and I am of opinion, that they will
yeeld us no lesse delight, then those related (this day) have done. When she
had thus spoken, she rose; granting them all liberty, to goe recreate themselves
untill Supper time.</p>

<p>The Ladies being thus at their owne disposing, some of them bared
their legges and feete, to wash them in the coole current. Others, not so
minded, walked on the greene grasse, and under the goodly spreading
trees. <i>Dioneus</i> and Madame <i>Fiammetta</i>, they sate singing together,
the love-warre betweene <i>Arcit</i> and <i>Palemon</i>. And thus with diversity
of disports, in choice delight and much contentment, all were imployed,
till Supper drew neere. When the houre was come, and the Tables
covered by the Ponds side: we need not question their dyet and dainties,
infinite Birds sweetly singing about them, as no musicke in the world
could be more pleasing; beside calme windes, fanning their faces from
the neighbouring hilles (free from flyes, or the least annoyance) made a
delicate addition to their pleasure.</p>

<p>No sooner were the Tables withdrawne, and all risen: but they
fetcht a few turnings about the vally, because the Sunne was not (as yet)
quite set. Then in the coole evening, according to the Queenes appointment:
in a soft and gentle pace, they walked homeward: devising
on a thousand occasions, as well those which the dayes discourses had
yeelded, as others of their owne inventing beside. It was almost darke
night, before they arrived at the Pallace; where, with variety of choice
Wines, and abounding plenty of rare Banquetting, they out-wore the
little toile and wearinesse, which the long walke had charged them withall.
Afterward, according to their wonted order, the Instruments being
brought and played on, they fell to dancing about the faire Fountaine;
<i>Tindaro</i> intruding (now and then) the sound of his Bagpipe, to make the
musicke seeme more melodious. But in the end, the Queene commanded
Madame <i>Philomena</i> to sing; whereupon the Instruments being tuned
fit for the purpose, thus she began.</p>

<p>This Song gave occasion to the whole Company, to imagine, that
some new and pleasing apprehension of Love, constrained Madame
<i>Philomena</i> to sing in this manner. And because (by the discourse thereof)
it plainely appeared, that shee had felt more then shee saw, shee was so
much the more happy, and the like was wished by all the rest. Wherefore,
after the Song was ended; the Queene remembring, that the next
day following was Friday, turning her selfe graciously to them all, thus
she spake.</p>

<p>You know noble Ladies, and you likewise most noble Gentlemen, that to
morrow is the day consecrated to the Passion of our blessed Lord and Saviour,
which (if you have not forgotten it, as easily you cannot) we devoutly
celebrated, Madame <i>Neiphila</i> being then Queene, ceasing from all our
pleasant discoursing, as we did the like on the Saturday following, sanctifying
the sacred Sabboth, in due regard of it selfe. Wherefore, being desirous
to imitate precedent good example, which in worthy manner shee began to
us all: I hold it very decent and necessary, that we should asttaine to morrow,
and the day ensuing, from recounting any of our pleasant Novels, reducing
to our memories, what was done (as on those dayes) for the salvation
of our soules. This holy and Religious motion made by the Queene,
was commendably allowed by all the assembly, and therefore, humbly
taking their leave of her, and an indifferent part of the night
being already spent; severally they betooke themselves to their Chambers.</p>

imposed, is, Concerning such Wittie deceyvings;
as have, or may be put in practise, by Wives

<h4>The Induction.</h4>


<p>Earely on the Sonday Morning,
<i>Aurora</i> shewing her selfe bright and
lovely; the Sunnes Golden beames
beganne to appeare, on the toppes of
the neere adjoyning Mountaines; so,
that Hearbes, Plants, Trees, and all
things else, were verie evidently to be
discerned. The Queene and her Companie, being all
come foorth of their Chambers, and having walked a
while abroad, in the goodly greene Meadowes, to taste
the sweetnesse of the fresh and wholesome ayre, they returned
backe againe into the Palace, because it was their
dutie so to do.</p>

<p>Afterward, betweene the houres of seaven and eight,
they went to heare Masse, in a faire Chappell neere at
hand, and thence returned to their Lodgings. When
they had dined merrily together, they fell to their wonted
singing and dauncing: Which beeing done, such as
were so pleased (by License of the Queene first obtained)
went either to their rest, or such exercises as they tooke
most delight in. When midday, and the heate thereof
was well over-past, so that the aire seemed mild and temperate:
according as the Queene had commanded; they
were all seated againe about the Fountaine, with intent
to prosecute their former pastime. And then Madame

speaker for this day, beganne as
followeth.</p>

<h2>The First Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is declared, that such women as will make sale of their honestie,
are sometimes over-reached in their payment, and justly served as they
should be.</i></h4>


<p>Seeing it is my fortune, Gracious Ladies, that I must give beginning
to this dayes discoursing, by some such Novel which
I thinke expedient; as duty bindeth me, I am therewith well
contented. And because the deceits of Women to men, have beene at
large and liberally related; I will tell you a subtile tricke of a man to a
Woman. Not that I blame him for the deede, or thinke the deceyte
not well fitted to the woman: but I speake it in a contrarie nature, as
commending the man, and condemning the woman very justly, as also
to shew, how men can as well beguile those crafty companions, which
least beleeve any such cunning in them, as they that stand most on their
artificiall skill.</p>

<p>Howbeit, to speake more properly, the matter by me to be reported,
deserveth not the reproachfull title of deceite, but rather of a recompence
duly returned: because women ought to be chaste and honest, &amp;
to preserve their honour as their lives, without yeelding to the contamination
thereof, for any occasion whatsoever. And yet (neverthelesse,
in regard of our frailty) many times we proove not so constant as
we should be: yet I am of opinion, that she which selleth her honestie
for money, deserveth justly to be burned. Whereas on the contrary,
she that falleth into the offence, onely through intire affection (the powerfull
lawes of Love beeing above all resistance) in equity meriteth
pardon, especially of a Judge not over-rigorous: as not long since wee
heard from <i>Philostratus</i>, in revealing what hapned to Madam <i>Phillippa
de Prato</i>, upon the dangerous Edict.</p>

<p>Understand then, my most worthy Auditors, that there lived sometime
in <i>Millaine</i> an <i>Almaigne</i> Soldiour, named <i>Gulfardo</i>, of commendable
carriage in his person, and very faithfull to such as he served, a
matter not common among the <i>Almaignes</i>. And because he made just
repayment, to every one which lent him monies; he grew to such especiall
credit, and was so familiar with the very best Marchants; as (manie
times) he could not be so ready to borrow, as they were willing alwaies
to lend him. He thus continuing in the Cittie of <i>Millaine</i>, fastened his
affection on a verie beautifull Gentlewoman, named Mistresse <i>Ambrosia</i>,
Wife unto a rich Merchant, who was called Signior <i>Gasparuolo Sagastraccio</i>,
who had good knowledge of him, and respectively used him.
Loving this Gentlewoman with great discretion, without the least apprehension
of her husband: he sent upon a day to entreate conference
with her, for enjoying the fruition of her love, and she should find him
ready to fulfill whatsoever she pleased to command him, as, at any time
he would make good his promise.</p>

<p>The Gentlewoman, after divers of these private solicitings, resolutely
answered, that she was as ready to fulfill the request of <i>Gulfardo</i>, provided,
that two especiall considerations might ensue thereon. First, the
faithfull concealing thereof from any person living. Next, because she
knew him to be rich, and she had occasion to use two hundred Crowns,
about businesse of important consequence: he should freely bestow so
many on her, and (ever after) she was to be commanded by him. <i>Gulfardo</i>
perceiving the covetousnesse of this woman, who (notwithstanding
his doting affection) he thought to be intirely honest to her Husband:
became so deepely offended at her vile answere, that his fervent
love converted into as earnest loathing her; determining constantlie to
deceive her, and to make her avaritious motion, the only means whereby
to effect it.</p>

<p>He sent her word, that he was willing to performe her request, or any
farre greater matter for her: in which respect, he onely desired for to
know, when she would be pleased to have him come see her, and to receive
the money of him? No creature hee acquainted with his setled
purpose, but onely a deere friend and kinde companion, who alwayes
used to keepe him company, in the neerest occasions that concerned
him. The Gentlewoman, or rather most disloyall wife, uppon this answer
sent her, was extraordinarily jocond and contented, returning him
a secret Letter, wherein she signified: that <i>Gasparuolo</i> her husband, had
important affaires which called him to <i>Geneway</i>: but he should understand
of his departure, and then (with safety) he might come see her, as
also his bringing of the Crownes.</p>

<p>In the meane while, <i>Gulfardo</i> having determined what he would do,
watched a convenient time, when he went unto <i>Gasparuolo</i>, and sayde:
Sir, I have some businesse of maine importance, and shall neede to use but
two hundred Crownes onely: I desire you to lend me so many Crownes, upon
such profite as you were wont to take of mee, at other times when I have
made use of you, and I shall not faile you at my day.</p>

<p><i>Gasparuolo</i> was well contented with the motion, and made no more
adoe, but counted downe the Crownes: departing thence (within few
dayes after) for <i>Geneway</i>, acording to his Wives former message; she giving
<i>Gulfardo</i> also intelligence of his absence, that now (with safety) hee
might come see her, and bring the two hundred Crownes with him.</p>

<p><i>Gulfardo</i>, taking his friend in his company, went to visite Mistresse
<i>Ambrosia</i>, whom he found in expectation of his arrivall, and the first
thing he did, he counted downe the two hundred Crownes; and delivering
them to her in the presence of his friend, saide: Mistresse <i>Ambrosia</i>,
receive these two hundred Crownes, which I desire you to pay unto your
Husband on my behalfe, when he is returned from <i>Geneway. Ambrosia</i>,
receyved the two hundred Crownes, not regarding wherefore <i>Gulfardo</i>
used these words: because shee verily beleeved, that hee spake in
such manner, because his friend should take no notice, of his giving
them to her, upon any covenant passed betweene them; whereuppon,
she sayde. Sir, I will pay them to my Husband for you; and cause him to
give you a sufficient discharge: but first I will count them over my selfe, to
see whether the summe be just, or no. And having drawne them over upon
the Table, the summe containing truly two hundred Crownes (wherewith
she was most highly contented) she lockt them safe uppe in her Cuppe-boord,
and <i>Gulfardoes</i> Friend being gone (as formerly it was compacted
betweene them) shee came to converse more familiarly with him,
having provided a banquet for him. What passed between them afterward,
both then, and oftentimes beside, before her Husbande returned
home, is a matter out of my element, and rather requires my ignorance
then knowledge.</p>

<p>When <i>Gasparuolo</i> was come from <i>Geneway, Gulfardo</i> observing a
convenient time, when he was sitting at the doore with his Wife; tooke
his Friend with him, and comming to <i>Gasparuolo</i>, said. Worthy Sir, the
two hundred Crownes which you lent me, before your journey to <i>Geneway</i>,
in regard they could not serve my turne, to compasse the businesse for which
I borrowed them: within a day or two after, in the presence of this Gentleman
my friend, I made repayment of them to your wife, and therefore I
pray you crosse me out of your booke.</p>

<p><i>Gasparuolo</i> turning to his Wife, demanded; Whether it was so, or no?
She beholding the witnesse standing by, who was also present at her
receyving them: durst not make deniall, but thus answered. Indeede
Husband, I received two hundred Crownes of the Gentleman, and never
remembred, to acquaint you therewith since your comming home: but hereafter
I will be made no more your receiver, except I carried a quicker memory.</p>

<p>Then saide <i>Gasparuolo</i>: Signior <i>Gulfardo</i>, I finde you alwaies a most
honest Gentleman, and will be readie at any time, to doe you the like, or a
farre greater kindnesse; depart at your pleasure, and feare not the crossing
of my Booke. So <i>Gulfardo</i> went away merrily contented, and <i>Ambrosia</i>
was served as she justly merited; she paying the price of her owne leudnesse
to her Husband, which she had a more covetous intent to keepe,
questionlesse, not caring how many like lustfull matches shee coulde
make, to be so liberally rewarded, if this had succeeded to her minde:
whereas he shewed himselfe wise and discreete, in paying nothing
for his pleasure, and requiting a covetous
queane in her
kinde.</p>

without a pawne: she sent him backe his Cloake againe, albeit greatly against

<h2>The Second Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Approving, that no promise is to be kept with such Women as will make sale
of their honesty for coyne. A warning also for men, not to suffer Priests
to be over familiar with their wives.</i></h4>


<p>Both the Gentlemen and Ladies gave equall commendations,
of <i>Gulfardoes</i> queint beguiling the <i>Millaine</i> Gentlewoman
<i>Ambrosia</i>, and wishing all other (of her minde) might alwaies
be so served. Then the Queene, smiling on <i>Pamphilus</i>, commaunded
him to follow next: whereupon, thus he began.</p>

<p>I can tell you (faire Ladies) a short Novell, against such as are continually
offensive to us, yet we being no way able to offend him; at least, in the
same manner as they do injurie us. And for your better understanding what
and who they be, they are our lusty Priests, who advance their Standard,
and make their publike predications against our wives, winning such advantage
over them, that they can pardon them both of the sinne and punishment,
whensoever they are once subjected unto theyr perswasions,
even as if they brought the Soldane bound and captived, from <i>Alexandria</i>
to <i>Avignon</i>. Which imperious power, we (poore soules) cannot exercise on
them, considering, we have neither heart nor courage, to do our devoire in
just revenge on their Mothers, Sisters, Daughters, and Friends, with the
like spirit as they rise in armes against our wives. And therefore, I meant
to tell you a tale of a Country mans wife, more to make you laugh at the conclusion
thereof; then for any singularity of words or matter: yet this benefite
you may gaine thereby, of an apparant proofe that such Sinamon, amorous
and perswading Priests, are not alwayes to be credited on their words
or promises.</p>

<p>Let me then tell you, that at <i>Varlungo</i>, which you know to bee not
farre distant hence, there dwelt an youthfull Priest, lustie, gallant, and
proper of person (especially for Womens service) commonly called by
the name of sweet Sir <i>Simon</i>. Now, albeit he was a man of slender reading,
yet notwithstanding, he had store of Latine sentences by heart;
some true, but twice so many maimed and false, Saint-like shewes, holy
speeches, and ghostly admonitions, which hee would preach under an
Oake in the fields, when he had congregated his Parishioners together.
When women lay in childe-bed, hee was their daily comfortable visitant,
and would man them from their houses, when they had any occasion
to walke abroad: carrying alwaies a bottle of holy water about
him, wherewith he would sprinkle them by the way, peeces of hallowed
Candles, and Chrisome Cakes, which pleased women extraordinarily,
and all the Country affoorded not such another frolicke Priest, as
this our nimble and active sweet Sir <i>Simon</i>.</p>

<p>Among many other of his feminine Parishioners, all of them being
hansome and comely Women: yet there was one more pleasing in his
wanton eye, then any of the rest, named <i>Monna Belcolore</i>, and wife to
a plaine mecanicke man, called <i>Bentivegna del Mazzo</i>. And, to speake
uprightly, few Countrey Villages yeelded a Woman, more fresh and
lovely of complexion, although not admirable for beauty, yet sweete
Sir <i>Simon</i> thought her a Saint, and faine would be offering at her shrine.
Divers pretty pleasing qualities she had, as sounding the Cymball, playing
artificially on the Timbrill, and singing thereto as it had beene a
Nightingale, dancing also so dexteriously, as happy was the man that
could dance in her company. All which so enflamed sweet Sir <i>Simon</i>,
that he lost his wonted sprightly behaviour, walked sullen, sad and melancholly,
as if he had melted all his mettall, because hee could hardly
have a sight of her. But on the Sonday morning, when hee heard or
knew that she was in the Church, hee would tickle it with a <i>Kyrie</i> and a
<i>Sanctus</i>, even as if hee contended to shewe his singular skill in singing,
when it had beene as good to heare an Asse bray. Whereas on the contrary,
when she came not to Church, Masse, and all else were quicklie
shaken uppe, as if his devotion waited onely on her presence. Yet
he was so cunning in the carriage of his amorous businesse, both for her
credite and his owne; as <i>Bentivegna</i> her husband could not perceive it,
or any neighbour so much as suspect it.</p>

<p>But, to compasse more familiar acquaintance with <i>Belcolore</i>, hee sent
her sundry gifts and presents, day by day, as sometime a bunch of dainty
greene Garlicke, whereof he had plenty growing in his Garden, which
he manured with his owne hands, and better then all the countrey yeelded;
otherwhiles a small basket of Pease or Beanes, and Onyons or
Scallions, as the season served. But when he could come in place where
she was; then he darted amourous wincks and glances at her, with becks,
nods, and blushes, Loves private Ambassadours, which shee (being but
countrey-bred) seeming by outward appearance, not to see, retorted disdainefully,
and forthwith would absent her selfe, so that sweet Sir <i>Simon</i>
laboured still in vaine, and could not compasse what he coveted.</p>

<p>It came to passe within a while after, that on a time, (about high
noone) Sir <i>Simon</i> being walking abroad, chanced to meete with <i>Bentivegna</i>,
driving an Asse before him, laden with divers commodities, and
demaunding of him, whither he went, <i>Bentivegna</i>, thus answered. In
troth Sir <i>Simon</i>, I am going to the City, about some especiall businesse of
mine owne, and I carry these things to Signior <i>Bonacorci da Cinestreto</i>,
because he should helpe me before the Judge, when I shall be called in question
concerning my patrimony. Sir <i>Simon</i> looking merrily on him, said. Thou
doest well <i>Bentivegna</i>, to make a friend sure before thou need him; goe, take
my blessing with thee, and returne againe with good successe. But if thou
meet with <i>Laguccio</i>, or <i>Naldino</i>, forget not to tell them, that they must
bring me my shooe-tyes before Sunday. <i>Bentivegna</i> said, hee would discharge
his errand, and so parted from him, driving his Asse on towards
<i>Florence</i>.</p>

<p>Now began Sir <i>Simon</i> to shrug, and scratch his head, thinking this to
be a fit convenient time, for him to goe visite <i>Belcolore</i>, and to make triall
of his fortune: wherefore, setting aside all other businesse, he stayed
no where till he came to the house, whereinto being entred, he saide:
All happinesse be to them that dwell heere. <i>Belcolore</i> being then above in
the Chamber, when she heard his tongue, replyed. Sweet Sir <i>Simon</i>!
you are heartely welcome, whether are you walking, if the question may bee
demaunded? Beleeve me dainty Ducke, answered Sir <i>Simon</i>, I am come
to sit a while with thee, because I met thy Husband going to the Citie. By
this time, <i>Belcolore</i> was descended downe the stayres, and having once
againe given welcome to Sir <i>Simon</i>, she sate downe by him, cleansing
of Colewort seeds from such other course chaffe, which her Husband
had prepared before his departure.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Simon</i> hugging her in his armes, and fetching a vehement sigh,
said. My <i>Belcolore</i>, how long shall I pine and languish for thy love? How
now Sir <i>Simon</i>? answered she, is this behaviour fitting for an holy man?
Holy-men <i>Belcolore</i>, (quoth Sir <i>Simon</i>) are made of the same matter as
others be, they have the same affections, and therefore subject to their infirmities.
Santa Maria, answered <i>Belcolore</i>, Dare Priests doe such
things as you talke of? Yes <i>Belcolore</i> (quoth he) and much better then other
men can, because they are made for the very best businesse, in which regard
they are restrained from marriage. True (quoth <i>Belcolore</i>) but much
more from meddling with other mens wives. Touch not that Text <i>Belcolore</i>,
replyed Sir <i>Simon</i>, it is somewhat above your capacity: talke of that I
come for, namely thy love, my Ducke, and my Dove. Sir <i>Simon</i> is thine, I
pray thee be mine.</p>

<p><i>Belcolore</i> observing his smirking behaviour, his proper person, pretty
talke, and queint insinuating; felt a motion to female frailty, which yet
she would withstand so long as she could, and not be over-hasty in her
yeelding. Sir <i>Simon</i> promiseth her a new paire of shoes, garters, ribbands,
girdles, or what else she would request. Sir <i>Simon</i> (quoth she) all
these things which you talke of, are fit for women: but if your love to mee
be such as you make choice of, fulfill what I will motion to you, and then
(perhaps) I shall tell you more. Sir <i>Simons</i> heate made him hasty to promise
whatsoever she would desire; whereupon, thus shee replyed. On
Saturday, said she, I must goe to <i>Florence</i>, to carry home such yarne as was
sent me to spinne, and to amend my spinning wheele: if you will lend mee
ten Florines, wherewith I know you are alwayes furnished, I shall redeeme
from the Usurer my best peticote, and my wedding gowne (both well neere
lost for lacke of repaiment) without which I cannot be seene at Church, or in
any other good place else, and then afterward other matters may be accomplished.</p>

<p>Alas sweet <i>Belcolore</i> answered Sir <i>Simon</i>, I never beare any such sum
about me, for men of our profession, doe seldome carry any money at all: but
beleeve me on my word, before Saturday come, I will not faile to bring them
hither. Oh Sir (quoth <i>Belcolore</i>) you men are quicke promisers, but slow
performers. Doe you thinke to use me, as poore <i>Billezza</i> was, who trusted
to as faire words, and found her selfe deceived? Now Sir <i>Simon</i>, her example
in being made scandall to the world, is a sufficient warning for me:
if you be not so provided, goe and make use of your friend, for I am not otherwise
to be moved. Nay <i>Belcolore</i> (quoth he) I hope you will not serve
me so, but my word shall be of better worth with you. Consider the conveniency
of time, wee being so privately here alone: whereas at my returning
hither againe, some hinderance may thwart me, and the like opportunity
be never obtained. Sir, Sir, (said she) you have heard my resolution; if
you will fetche the Florines, doe; otherwise, walke about your businesse, for I
am a woman of my word.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Simon</i> perceiving, that she would not trust him upon bare words,
nor any thing was to be done, without <i>Salvum me fac</i>, whereas his meaning
was <i>Sine custodia</i>; thus answered. Well <i>Belcolore</i>, seeing you dare
not credit my bringing the tenne Florines, according to my promised day:
I will leave you a good pawne, my very best cloake, lyned quite thorough
with rich Silke, and made up in the choysest manner.</p>

<p><i>Belcolore</i> looking on the Cloake, said. How much may this Cloake bee
worth? How much? quoth Sir <i>Simon</i>, upon my word <i>Belcolore</i>, it is of
a right fine Flanders Serdge, and not above eight dayes since, I bought it thus
(ready made) of <i>Lotto</i> the Fripperer, and payed for it sixe and twenty Florines,
a pledge then sufficient for your ten. Is it possible, said shee, that it
should cost so much? Well, Sir <i>Simon</i>, deliver it me first, I will lay it up safe
for you against Saturday, when if you fetch it not; I will redeeme mine owne
things with it, and leave you to release it your selfe.</p>

<p>The Cloake is laid up by <i>Belcolore</i>, and Sir <i>Simon</i> so forward in his affection;
that (in briefe) he enjoyed what hee came for; and departed afterward
in his light tripping Cassocke, but yet thorow by-Lanes, and no
much frequented places, smelling on a Nosegay, as if hee had beene at
some wedding in the Countrey, and went thus lightly without his
Cloake, for his better ease. As commonly after actions of evill, Repentance
knocketh at the doore of Conscience, and urgeth a guilty remembrance,
with some sence of sorrow: so was it now with sweet Sir <i>Simon</i>,
who survaying over all his Vailes of offering Candles, the validity of his
yearely benefits, and all comming nothing neere the summe of (scarce
halfe) sixe and twenty Florines; he began to repent his deed of darkenesse,
although it was acted in the day-time, and considered with himselfe,
by what honest (yet unsuspected meanes) hee might recover his
Cloake againe, before it went to the Broaker, in redemption of <i>Belcolores</i>
pawned apparrell, and yet to send her no Florines neither.</p>

<p>Having a cunning reaching wit, especially in matters for his owne
advantage, and pretending to have a dinner at his lodging, for a few of
some invited friends: he made use of a neighbours Boy, sending him to
the house of <i>Belcolore</i>, with request of lending him her Stone Morter, to
make Greene-sawce in for his guests, because hee had meate required
such sawce. <i>Belcolore</i> suspecting no treachery, sent him the Stone Morter
with the Pestell, and about dinner time, when he knew <i>Bentivegna</i> to
bee at home with his wife, by a spye which was set for the purpose; hee
called the Clearke (usually attending on him) and said. Take this Morter
and Pestell, beare them home to <i>Belcolore</i>, and tell her: Sir <i>Simon</i>
sends them home with thankes, they having sufficiently served his turne,
and desire her likewise, to send me my Cloake, which the Boy left as a
pledge for better remembrance, and because she would not lend it without
a pawne.</p>

<p>The Clearke comming to the house of <i>Belcolore</i>, found her sitting at
dinner with her Husband, and delivering her the Pestell and Morter,
performed the rest of Sir <i>Simons</i> message. <i>Belcolore</i> hearing the Cloake
demaunded, stept up to make answere: But <i>Bentivegna</i>, seeming (by his
lookes) to be much offended, roughly replyed. Why how now wife? Is not
Sir <i>Simon</i> our especiall friend, and cannot be be pleasured without a pawne?
I protest upon my word, I could find in my heart to smite thee for it. Rise
quickely thou wert best, and send him backe his Cloake; with this warning
hereafter, that whatsoever he will have, be it your poore Asse, or any thing else
being ours, let him have it: and tell him (Master Clearke) he may command it.
<i>Belcolore</i> rose grumbling from the Table, and fetching the Cloake forth
of the Chest, which stood neere at hand in the same roome; shee delivered
it to the Clearke, saying. Tell Sir <i>Simon</i> from me, and boldly say you
heard me speake it: that I made a vow to my selfe, he shall never make use of
my Morter hereafter, to beat any more of his sawcinesse in, let my Husband
say whatsoever he will, I speake the word, and will performe it.</p>

<p>Away went the Clearke home with the Cloake, and told Sir <i>Simon</i>
what she had said, whereto he replyed. If I must make use of her Morter
no more; I will not trust her with the keeping of my Cloake, for feare it goe
to gage indeed.</p>

<p><i>Bentivegna</i> was a little displeased at his wives words, because hee
thought she spake but in jest; albeit <i>Belcolore</i> was so angry with Sir <i>Simon</i>,
that she would not speake to him till vintage time following. But
then Sir <i>Simon</i>, what by sharpe threatenings of her soule to be in danger
of hell fire, continuing so long in hatred of a holy Priest, which words
did not a little terrifie her; besides daily presents to her, of sweet new
Wines, roasted Chesse-nuts, Figges and Almonds: all unkindnesse became
converted to former familiarity; the garments were redeemed;
he gave her Sonnets which she would sweetly sing to
her Cimbale, and further friendship increased
betweene her and sweet Sir <i>Simon.</i></p>

stones. His Wife rebuking him for his absence, hee groweth into
anger, and shrewdly beateth her. Afterward, when the case is debated
among his other friends</i> Bruno <i>and</i> Buffalmaco, <i>all is found
to be meere foolery.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Third Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Justly reprehending the simplicity of such men, as are too much addicted
to credulitie, and will give credit to every thing they
heare.</i></h4>


<p><i>Pamphilus</i> having ended his Novell, whereat the Ladies
laughed exceedingly, so that very hardly they could give
over: The Queene gave charge to Madame <i>Eliza</i>, that
shee should next succeed in order; when, being scarcely able to refraine
from smyling, thus she began.</p>

<p>I know not (Gracious Ladies) whether I can move you to as hearty
laughter, with a briefe Novell of mine owne, as <i>Pamphilus</i> lately
did with his: yet I dare assure you, that it is both true and pleasant,
and I will relate it in the best manner I can.</p>

<p>In our owne Citie, which evermore hath contained all sorts of people,
not long since there dwelt, a Painter, named <i>Calandrino</i>, a simple
man; yet as much addicted to matters of novelty, as any man whatsoever
could be. The most part of his time, he spent in the company of two other
Painters, the one called <i>Bruno</i>, and the other <i>Buffalmaco</i>, men of very
recreative spirits, and of indifferent good capacity; often resorting to
the said <i>Calandrino</i>, because they tooke delight in his honest simplicity,
and pleasant order of behaviour. At the same time likewise, there
dwelt in <i>Florence</i>, a young Gentleman of singular disposition, to every
generous and witty conceite, as the world did not yeeld a more pleasant
companion, he being named <i>Maso del Saggio</i>, who having heard somwhat
of <i>Calandrinos</i> sillinesse: determined to jest with him in merry
manner, and to suggest his longing humors after Novelties, with some
conceit of extraordinary nature.</p>

<p>He happening (on a day) to meete him in the Church of Saint
<i>John</i>, and seeing him seriously busied, in beholding the rare pictures,
and the curious carved Tabernacle, which (not long before) was
placed on the high Altar in the said Church: considered with himselfe,
that he had now fit place and opportunity, to effect what hee
had long time desired. And having imparted his minde to a very
intimate friend, how he intended to deale with simple <i>Calandrino</i>:
they went both very neere him, where he sate all alone, and making
shew as if they saw him not; began to consult between themselves,
concerning the rare properties of precious stones; whereof <i>Maso</i>
discoursed as exactly, as he had beene a most skilfull Lapidarie; to
which conference of theirs, <i>Calandrino</i> lent an attentive eare, in regard
it was matter of singular rarity.</p>

<p>Soone after, <i>Calandrino</i> started up, and perceiving by their loude
speaking, that they talked of nothing which required secret Counsell:
he went into their company (the onely thing which <i>Maso</i> desired)
and holding on still the former Argument; <i>Calandrino</i> would
needs request to know, in what place these precious stones were to
be found, which had such excellent vertues in them? <i>Maso</i> made
answere, that the most of them were to be had in <i>Berlinzona</i>, neere
to the City of <i>Bascha</i>, which was in the Territory of a Countrey,
called <i>Bengodi</i>, where the Vines were bound about with Sawcidges,
a Goose was sold for a penny, and the Goslings freely given in
to boote. There was also an high mountaine, wholly made of <i>Parmezane</i>,
grated Cheese, whereon dwelt people, who did nothing
else but make <i>Mocharones</i> and <i>Raviuolies</i>, boiling them with broth
of Capons, and afterward hurled them all about, to whosoever can
or will catch them. Neere to this mountaine runneth a faire River,
the whole streame being pure white Bastard, none such was ever
sold for any money, and without one drop of water in it.</p>

<p>Now trust me Sir, (said <i>Calandrino</i>) that is an excellent Countrey
to dwell in: but I pray you tell me Sir, what doe they with the Capons
after they have boyld them? The <i>Baschanes</i> (quoth <i>Maso</i>) eate them
all. Have you Sir, said <i>Calandrino</i>, at any time beene in that Countrey?
How? answered <i>Maso</i>, doe you demaund if I have beene there?
Yes man, above a thousand times, at the least. How farre Sir, I pray
you (quoth <i>Calandrino</i>) is that worthy Countrey, from this our City?
In troth replyed <i>Maso</i>, the miles are hardly to be numbred, for the
most part of them we travell when we are nightly in our beddes,
and if a man dreame right; he may be there upon a sudden.</p>

<p>Surely Sir, said <i>Calandrino</i>, it is further hence, then to <i>Abruzzi</i>?
Yes questionlesse, replyed <i>Maso</i>; but, to a willing minde, no travell
seemeth tedious.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> well noting, that <i>Maso</i> delivered all these speeches,
with a stedfast countenance, no signe of smyling, or any gesture to
urge the least mislike: he gave such credit to them, as to any matter
of apparent and manifest truth, and upon this assured confidence, he
said.</p>

<p>Beleeve me Sir, the journey is over-farre for mee to undertake,
but if it were neerer; I could affoord to goe in your Company; onely
to see how they make these <i>Macherones</i>, and to fill my belly with
them.</p>

<p>But now wee are in talke Sir, I pray you pardon mee to aske, whether
any such precious stones, as you spake off, are to be found in that
Countrey, or no? Yes indeed, replyed <i>Maso</i>, there are two kinds of them
to be found in those Territories, both being of very great vertue. One
kind, are gritty stones, of <i>Settignano</i>, and of <i>Montisca</i>, by vertue of
which places, when any Mill-stones or Grind-stones are to bee made,
they knede the sand as they use to doe meale, and so make them of what
bignesse they please. In which respect, they have have a common saying
there: that Nature maketh common stones, but <i>Montisca</i> Mill-stones.
Such plenty are there of these Mill-stones, so slenderly here esteemed among
us, as Emeralds are with them, whereof they have whole mountaines,
farre greater then our <i>Montemorello</i>, which shine most gloriously
at midnight. And how meanly soever we account of their Mill-stones;
yet there they drill them, and enchase them in Rings, which afterward
they send to the great Soldane, and have whatsoever they will
demaund for them.</p>

<p>The other kinde is a most precious Stone indeede, which our best Lapidaries
call the <i>Helitropium</i>, the vertue whereof is so admirable;
as whosoever beareth it about him, so long as he keepeth it, it is impossible
for any eye to discerne him, because he walketh meerely invisible. O
Lord Sir (quoth <i>Calandrino</i>) these stones are of rare vertue indeede:
but where else may a man finde that <i>Helitropium</i>? Whereto <i>Maso</i>
thus answered: That Countrey onely doth not containe the <i>Helitropium</i>;
for they be many times found upon our plaine of <i>Mugnone</i>.
Of what bignesse Sir (quoth <i>Calandrino</i>) is the Stone, and what coulour?
The <i>Helitropium</i>, answered <i>Maso</i>, is not alwayes of one quality,
because some are bigge, and others lesse; but all are of one coulour,
namely blacke.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> committing all these things to respective memory,
and pretending to be called thence by some other especiall affaires;
departed from <i>Maso</i>, concluding resolvedly with himselfe, to finde
this precious stone, if possibly hee could: yet intending to doe nothing,
untill hee had acquainted <i>Bruno</i> and <i>Buffalmaco</i> therewith,
whom he loved dearly: he went in all hast to seeke them; because,
(without any longer trifling the time) they three might bee the first
men, that should find out this precious stone, spending almost the
whole morning, before they were all three met together. For they
were painting at the Monastery of the Sisters of <i>Faenza</i>, where they
had very serious imployment, and followed their businesse diligently:
where having found them, and saluting them in such kinde
manner, as continually he used to doe, thus he began.</p>

<p>Loving friends, if you were pleased to follow mine advise, wee three
will quickely be the richest men in <i>Florence</i>; because, by information
from a Gentleman (well deserving to be credited) on the Plaine of
<i>Mugnone</i>: there is a precious stone to be found, which whosoever carrieth
it about him, walketh invisible, and is not to be seene by any one.
Let us three be the first men to goe and finde it, before any other heare
thereof, and goe about it, and assure our selves that we shall finde it, for
I know it (by discription) so soone as I see it. And when wee have it,
who can hinder us from bearing it about us. Then will we goe to the
Tables of our Bankers, or money changers, which we see daily charged
with plenty of gold and silver, where we may take so much as wee list,
for they (nor any) are able to descrie us. So, (in short time) shall wee
all be wealthy, never needing to drudge any more, or paint muddy
walles, as hitherto we have done; and, as many of our poore profession
are forced to doe.</p>

<p><i>Bruno</i> and <i>Buffalmaco</i> hearing this, began to smile, and looking
merrily each on other, they seemed to wonder thereat, and greatly
commended the counsell of <i>Calandrino. Buffalmaco</i> demaunding
how the stone was named. Now it fortuned, that <i>Calandrino</i> (who
had but a grosse and blockish memory) had quite forgot the name
of the stone, and therefore said. What neede have wee of the name,
when we know, and are assured of the stones vertue? Let us make no
more adoe, but (setting aside all other businesse) goe seeke where it is to
be found. Well my friend (answered <i>Bruno</i>) you say wee may find it,
but how, and by what meanes?</p>

<p>There are two sorts of them (quoth <i>Calandrino</i>) some bigge, others
smaller, but all carry a blacke colour: therefore (in mine opinion) let
us gather all such stones as are blacke, so shall we be sure to finde it among
them, without any further losse of time.</p>

<p><i>Buffalmaco</i> and <i>Bruno</i>, liked and allowed the counsell of <i>Calandrino</i>,
which when they had (by severall commendations) given him
assurance of, <i>Bruno</i> saide. I doe not thinke it a convenient time now,
for us to go about so weighty a businesse: for the Sun is yet in the highest
degree, and striketh such a heate on the plaine of <i>Mugnone</i>, as all
the stones are extreamly dryed, and the very blackest will nowe seeme
whitest. But in the morning, after the dew is falne, and before the
Sunne shineth forth, every stone retaineth his true colour. Moreover,
there be many Labourers now working on the plaine, about such businesse
as they are severally assigned, who seeing us in so serious a serch:
may imagine what we seeke for, &amp; partake with us in the same inquisition,
by which meanes they may chance to speed before us, and so wee
may lose both our trot and amble. Wherefore, by my consent, if your
opinion jumpe with mine, this is an enterprise onely to be perfourmed
in an early morning, when the blacke stones are to be distinguisht from
the white, and a Festivall day were the best of all other, for then there
will be none to discover us.</p>

<p><i>Buffalmaco</i> applauded the advice of <i>Bruno</i>, and <i>Calandrino</i> did
no lesse, concluding all together; that Sunday morning (next ensuing)
should be the time, and then they all three would go seeke the
Stone. But <i>Calandrino</i> was verie earnest with them, that they shold
not reveale it to any living body, because it was tolde him as an especiall
secret: disclosing further to them, what hee had heard concerning
the Countrey of <i>Bengodi</i>, maintaining (with solemn oaths
and protestations) that every part thereof was true. Uppon this agreement,
they parted from <i>Calandrino</i>, who hardly enjoyed anie
rest at all, either by night or day, so greedie he was to bee possessed
of the stone. On the Sonday morning, hee called up his Companions
before breake of day, and going forth at S. <i>Galls</i> Port, they stayed
not, till they came to the plaine of <i>Mugnone</i>, where they searched
all about to finde this strange stone.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> went stealing before the other two, and verilie perswaded
himselfe, that he was borne to finde the <i>Helitropium</i>, and
looking on every side about him, hee rejected all other Stones but
the blacke, whereof first he filled his bosome, and afterwards, both
his Pockets. Then he tooke off his large painting Apron, which
he fastened with his girdle in the manner of a sacke, and that he filled
full of stones likewise. Yet not so satisfied, he spred abroad his
Cloake, which being also full of stones, hee bound it up carefully,
for feare of loosing the very least of them. All which <i>Buffalmaco</i>
and <i>Bruno</i> well observing (the day growing on, and hardly they
could reach home by dinner time) according as merrily they had
concluded, and pretending not to see <i>Calandrino</i>, albeit he was not
farre from them: What is become of <i>Calandrino</i>? saide <i>Buffalmaco.
Bruno</i> gazing strangely every where about him, as if hee were desirous
to finde him, replyed. I saw him not long since, for then he was
hard by before us; questionlesse, he hath given us the slippe, is privilie
gone home to dinner, and making starke fooles of us, hath lefte us to
picke up blacke stones, upon the parching plaines of <i>Mugnone</i>. Well
(quoth <i>Buffalmaco</i>) this is but the tricke of an hollow-hearted friend,
and not such as he protested himselfe to be, to us. Could any but wee
have bin so sottish, to credit his frivolous perswasions, hoping to finde any
stones of such vertue, and here on the fruitlesse plains of <i>Mugnone</i>?
No, no, none but we would have beleeved him.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> (who was close by them) hearing these wordes, and
seeing the whole manner of their wondering behaviour: became
constantly perswaded, that hee had not onely founde the precious
stone; but also had some store of them about him, by reason he was
so neere to them, and yet they could not see him, therefore he walked
before them. Now was his joy beyond all compasse of expression,
and being exceedingly proud of so happy an adventure: did
not meane to speake one word to them, but (heavily laden as hee
was) to steale home faire and softly before them, which indeede he
did, leaving them to follow after, if they would. <i>Bruno</i> perceiving
his intent, said to <i>Buffalmaco</i>: What remaineth now for us to doe?
Why should not we go home, as well as hee? And reason too, replyed
<i>Bruno</i>, It is in vaine to tarry any longer heere: but I solemnly protest,
<i>Calandrino</i> shall no more make an Asse of me: and were I now as neere
him, as not long since I was, I would give him such a remembrance on
the heele with this Flint stone, as should sticke by him this moneth, to
teach him a lesson for abusing his friends.</p>

<p>Hee threw the stone, and hit him shrewdly on the heele therewith;
but all was one to <i>Calandrino</i>, whatsoever they saide, or did,
as thus they still followed after him. And although the blow of the
stone was painfull to him; yet he mended his pace so wel as he was
able, in regard of beeing over-loaden with stones, and gave them
not one word all the way, because he tooke himselfe to bee invisible,
and utterly unseene of them. <i>Buffalmaco</i> taking uppe another
Flint-stone, which was indifferent heavie and sharp, said to <i>Bruno</i>.
Seest thou this Flint? Casting it from him, he smote <i>Calandrino</i> just
in the backe therewith, saying. Oh that <i>Calandrino</i> had bin so neere,
as I might have hit him on the backe with the stone. And thus all the
way on the plaine of <i>Mugnone</i>, they did nothing else but pelt him
with stones, even so farre as the Port of S. <i>Gall</i>, where they threwe
downe what other stones they had gathered, meaning not to molest
him any more, because they had done enough already.</p>

<p>There they stept before him unto the Port, and acquainted the
Warders with the whole matter, who laughing heartily at the jest,
the better to upholde it; would seeme not to see <i>Calandrino</i> in his
passage by them, but suffered him to go on, sore wearied with his
burthen, and sweating extreamly. Without resting himselfe in any
place, he came home to his house, which was neere to the corner
of the Milles, Fortune being so favourable to him in the course
of this mockery, that as he passed along the Rivers side, and afterward
through part of the City; he was neither met nor seen by any,
in regard they were all in their houses at dinner.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i>, every minute ready to sinke under his weightie burthen,
entred into his owne house, where (by great ill luck) his wife,
being a comely and very honest woman, and named <i>Monna Trista</i>,
was standing aloft on the stayres head. She being somewhat angry
for his so long absence, and seeing him come in grunting and groaning,
frowningly said. I thought that the divell would never let thee
come home, all the whole Citie have dined, and yet wee must remaine
without our dinner. When <i>Calandrino</i> heard this, &amp; perceived that
he was not invisible to his Wife: full of rage and wroth, hee began
to raile, saying. Ah thou wicked woman, where art thou? Thou hast
utterly undone me: but (as I live) I will pay thee soundly for it. Up
the staires he ascended into a small Parlour, where when he hadde
spred all his burthen of stones on the floore: he ran to his wife, catching
her by the haire of the head, and throwing her at his feete;
giving her so many spurns and cruel blowes, as shee was not able to
moove either armes or legges, notwithstanding all her teares, and
humble submission.</p>

<p>Now <i>Buffalmaco</i> and <i>Bruno</i>, after they had spent an indifferent
while, with the Warders at the Port in laughter; in a faire &amp; gentle
pace, they followed <i>Calandrino</i> home to his house, and being come
to the doore, they heard the harsh bickering betweene him and his
Wife, and seeming as if they were but newly arrived, they called
out alowd to him. <i>Calandrino</i> being in a sweate, stamping and raving
still at his Wife: looking forth of the window, entreated them
to ascend up to him, which they did, counterfetting greevous displeasure
against him. Being come into the roome, which they saw
all covered over with stones, his Wife sitting in a corner, all the
haire (well-neere) torne off her head, her face broken and bleeding,
and all her body cruelly beaten; on the other side, <i>Calandrino</i> standing
unbraced and ungirded, strugling and wallowing, like a man
quite out of breath: after a little pausing, <i>Bruno</i> thus spake.</p>

<p>Why how now <i>Calandrino</i>? What may the meaning of this matter
be? What, art thou preparing for building, that thou hast provided
such plenty of stones? How sitteth thy poore wife? How hast thou misused
her? Are these the behaviours of a wise or honest man? <i>Calandrino</i>,
utterly over-spent with travaile, and carrying such an huge
burthen of stones, as also the toylesome beating of his Wife, (but
much more impatient and offended, for that high good Fortune,
which he imagined to have lost:) could not collect his spirits together,
to answer them one ready word, wherefore hee sate fretting
like a mad man. Whereupon, <i>Buffalmaco</i> thus began to him. <i>Calandrino</i>,
if thou be angry with any other, yet thou shouldest not have
made such a mockery of us, as thou hast done: in leaving us (like a couple
of coxcombes) to the plaine of <i>Mugnone</i>, whether thou leddest us
with thee, to seeke a precious stone called <i>Helitropium</i>. And couldst
thou steale home, never bidding us so much as farewell? How can we
but take it in very evill part, that thou shouldest so abuse two honest
neighbours? Well, assure thy selfe, this is the last time that ever thou
shalt serve us so.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> (by this time) being somewhat better come to himselfe,
with an humble protestation of courtesie, returned them this
answer. Alas my good friends, be not you offended, the case is farre otherwise
then you immagine. Poore unfortunate man that I am, I
found the rare precious stone that you speake of: and marke me well, if I
do not tell you the truth of all. When you asked one another (the first
time) what was become of me; I was hard by you: at the most, within
the distance of two yards length; and perceiving that you saw mee not,
(being still so neere, and alwaies before you:) I went on, smiling to my
selfe, to heare you brabble and rage against me.</p>

<p>So, proceeding on in his discourse, he recounted every accident
as it hapned, both what they had saide and did unto him, concerning
the severall blowes, with the two Flint-stones, the one hurting
him greevously in the heele, and the other paining him as extreamly
in the backe, with their speeches used then, and his laughter,
notwithstanding hee felt the harme of them both, yet beeing
proud that he did so invisibly beguile them. Nay more (quoth he)
I cannot forbeare to tell you, that when I passed thorow the Port, I saw
you standing with the Warders; yet, by vertue of that excellent Stone,
undiscovered of you all. Beside, going along the streets, I met many of
my Gossips, friends, and familiar acquaintance, such as used daylie to
converse with me, and drinking together in every Tavern: yet not one
of them spake to me, neyther used any courtesie or salutation; which
(indeede) I did the more freely forgive them, because they were not able
to see me.</p>

<p>In the end of all, when I was come home into mine owne house, this
divellish and accursed woman, being aloft uppon my stayres head, by
much misfortune chanced to see me; in regard (as it is not unknowne
to you) that women cause all things to lose their vertue. In which respect,
I that could have stild my selfe the onely happy man in <i>Florence</i>,
am now made most miserable. And therefore did I justly beate her, so
long as she was able to stand against mee, and I know no reason to the
contrary, why I should not yet teare her in a thousand peeces: for I may
well curse the day of our mariage, to hinder and bereave me of such an
invisible blessednesse.</p>

<p><i>Buffalmaco</i> and <i>Bruno</i> hearing this, made shew of verie much
mervailing thereat, and many times maintained what <i>Calandrino</i>
had said; being well neere ready to burst with laughter; considering,
how confidently he stood upon it, that he had found the wonderful
stone, and lost it by his wives speaking onely to him. But
when they saw him rise in fury once more, with intent to beat her
againe: then they stept betweene them; affirming, That the woman
had no way offended in this case, but rather he himself: who knowing
that women cause all things to lose their vertue, had not therefore expresly
commanded her, not to be seene in his presence all that day, untill
he had made full proofe of the stones vertue. And questionles, the
consideration of a matter so available and important, was quite taken
from him, because such an especiall happinesse, should not belong to
him only; but (in part) to his friends, whom he had acquainted therewith,
drew them to the plaine with him in companie, where they
tooke as much paines in serch of the stone, as possibly he did, or could;
and yet (dishonestly) he would deceive them, and beare it away covetously,
for his owne private benefit.</p>

<p>After many other, as wise and wholesome perswasions, which
he constantly credited, because they spake them, they reconciled
him to his wife, and she to him: but not without some difficulty in
him; who falling into wonderfull greefe and melancholy, for losse
of such an admirable precious stone, was in danger to have dyed,
within lesse then a month after.</p>

<h4><a name="The_Provost_belonging_to_the_Cathedrall_Church_of_Fiesola_fell_in_love" id="The_Provost_belonging_to_the_Cathedrall_Church_of_Fiesola_fell_in_love"><i>The Provost belonging to the Cathedrall Church of</i> Fiesola, <i>fell in love
with a Gentlewoman, being a widdow, and named</i> Piccarda, <i>who
hated him as much as he loved her. He imagining, that he lay with
her: by the Gentlewomans Bretheren, and the Byshop under whom
he served, was taken in bed with her Mayde, an ugly, foule, deformed
Slut.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Fourth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is declared, how love oftentimes is so powerfull in aged men,
and driveth them to such doating, that it redoundeth to their great
disgrace and punishment.</i></h4>


<p>Ladie <i>Eliza</i> having concluded her Novell, not without infinite
commendations of the whole company: the Queen
turning her lookes to Madame <i>Æmillia</i>, gave her such an
expresse signe, as she must needs follow next after Madame <i>Eliza</i>,
whereupon she began in this manner.</p>

<p>Vertuous Ladies, I very well remember (by divers Novels formerly
related) that sufficient hath beene sayde, concerning Priests and Religious
persons, and all other carrying shaven Crownes, in their luxurious
appetites and desires. But because no one can at any time say so
much, as thereto no more may be added: beside them alreadie spoken
of, I wil tel you another concerning the Provost of a Cathedrall Church,
who would needes (in despight of all the world) love a Gentlewoman
whether she would or no: and therefore, in due chastisement both unto
his age and folly, she gave him such entertainment as he justly deserved.</p>

<p>It is not unknowne unto you all, that the Cittie of <i>Fiesola</i>, the
mountaine whereof we may very easily hither discerne, hath bene
(in times past) a very great and most ancient City: although at this
day it is well-neere all ruined: yet neverthelesse, it alwaies was, and
yet is a Byshops See, albeit not of the wealthiest. In the same Citie,
and no long while since, neere unto the Cathedrall Church,
there dwelt a Gentlewoman, being a Widdow, and commonlie
there stiled by the name of Madame <i>Piccarda</i>, whose house and inheritance
was but small, wherewith yet she lived very contentedly
(having no wandering eye, or wanton desires) and no company
but her two Brethren, Gentlemen of especiall honest and gracious
disposition.</p>

<p>This Gentlewoman, being yet in the flourishing condition of
her time, did ordinarily resort to the Cathedrall Church, in holie
zeale, and religious devotion; where the Provost of the place, became
so enamored of her, as nothing (but the sight of her) yeelded
him any contentment. Which fond affection of his, was forwarded
with such an audacious and bold carriage, as hee dared to
acquaint her with his love, requiring her enterchange of affection,
and the like opinion of him, as he had of her. True it is, that he was
very farre entred into yeares, but young and lustie in his own proud
conceite, presuming strangely beyond his capacity, and thinking as
well of his abilitie, as the youthfullest gallant in the World could
doe. Whereas (in verie deede) his person was utterly displeasing,
his behaviour immodest and scandalous, and his usuall Language,
favouring of such sensualitie, as, very fewe or none cared
for his company. And if any Woman seemed respective of him,
it was in regard of his outside and profession, and more for feare,
then the least affection, and alwayes as welcome to them, as the
head-ake.</p>

<p>His fond and foolish carriage stil continuing to this Gentlewoman;
she being wise and vertuously advised, spake thus unto him.
Holy Sir, if you love me according as you protest, &amp; manifest by your
outward behaviour: I am the more to thanke you for it, being bound
in dutie to love you likewise. But if your Love have any harshe or unsavourie
taste, which mine is no way able to endure, neyther dare
entertaine in anie kinde whatsoever: you must and shall hold mee excused,
because I am made of no such temper. You are my ghostly and
spirituall Father, an Holy Priest. Moreover, yeares have made you honourably
aged; all which severall weighty considerations, ought to confirme
you in continency &amp; chastity. Remember withall (good sir) that I
am but a child to you in years, &amp; were I bent to any wanton appetites,
you shold justly correct me by fatherly counsell, such as most beautifieth
your sacred profession. Beside, I am a Widdow, and you are not ignorant,
how requisite a thing honestie is in widdowes. Wherefore, pardon
mee (Holy Father:) for, in such manner as you make the motion: I
desire you not to love mee, because I neither can or will at any time so
affect you.</p>

<p>The Provoste gaining no other grace at this time, would not so
give over for this first repulse, but pursuing her still with unbeseeming
importunity; many private meanes he used to her by Letters,
tokens, and insinuating ambassages; yea, whensoever shee came to
the Church, he never ceased his wearisome solicitings. Whereat
she growing greatly offended, and perceyving no likelyhood of his
desisting; became so tyred with his tedious suite, that she considered
with her selfe, how she might dispatch him as he deserved, because
she saw no other remedy. Yet shee would not attempte anie
thing in this case, without acquainting her Bretheren first therewith.
And having tolde them, how much shee was importuned by the
Provost, and also what course she meant to take (wherein they both
counselled and encouraged her:) within a few daies after, shee went
to Church as she was wont to do; where so soone as the Provost espyed
her: forthwith he came to her, and according to his continued
course, he fell into his amorous courting. She looking upon him
with a smiling countenance, and walking aside with him out of any
hearing: after he had spent many impertinent speeches, shee (venting
foorth manie a vehement sighe) at length returned him this
answer.</p>

<p>Reverend Father, I have often heard it saide: That there is not any
Fort or Castle, how strongly munited soever it bee; but by continuall
assayling, at length (of necessity) it must and will be surprized. Which
comparison, I may full well allude to my selfe. For, you having so long
time solicited me, one while with affable language, then againe with
tokens and entisements, of such prevailing power: as have broken the
verie barricado of my former deliberation, and yeelded mee uppe
as your prisoner, to be commanded at your pleasure, for now I am onely
devoted yours.</p>

<p>Well may you (Gentle Ladies) imagine, that this answere was
not a little welcome to the Provost; who, shrugging with conceyte
of joy, presently thus replyed. I thanke you Madame <i>Piccarda</i>, and
to tell you true, I held it almost as a miracle, that you could stand upon
such long resistance, considering, it never so fortuned to mee with anie
other. And I have many times saide to my selfe, that if women were
made of silver, they hardly could be worth a pennie, because there can
scarsely one be found of so good allay, as to endure the test and essay. But
let us breake off this frivolous conference, and resolve upon a conclusion;
How, when and where we may safely meete together. Worthy Sir,
answered <i>Piccarda</i>, your selfe may appoint the time whensoever you
please, because I have no Husband, to whom I should render any account
of my absence, or presence: but I am not provided of any place.</p>

<p>A pretty while the Provoste stood musing, and at last saide. A
place Madame? where can be more privacie, then in your owne house?
Alas Sir (quoth she) you know that I have two Gentlemen my brethren
who continually are with me, &amp; other of their friends beside: My
house also is not great, wherefore it is impossible to be there, except you
could be like a dumbe man, without speaking one word, or making the
very least noyse; beside, to remaine in darkenesse, as if you were blinde,
and who can be able to endure all these? And yet (without these) there
is no adventuring, albeit they never come into my Chamber: but their
lodging is so close to mine, as there cannot any word be spoken, be it never
so low or in whispering manner, but they heare it very easily. Madame
said the Provoste, for one or two nights, I can make hard shift.
Why Sir (quoth she) the matter onely remaineth in you, for if you be
silent and suffering, as already you have heard, there is no feare at all
of safty. Let me alone Madame, replyed the Provoste, I will bee governed
by your directions: but, in any case, let us begin this night.
With all my heart, saide shee. So appointing him how and when hee
should come; hee parted from her, and shee returned home to her
house.</p>

<p>Heere I am to tell you, that this Gentlewoman had a servant, in
the nature of an old maide, not indued with any well featured face,
but instead thereof, she had the ugliest and most counterfeit countenance,
as hardly could be seene a worse. She had a wrie mouth,
huge great lippes, foule teeth, great and blacke, a monstrous stinking
breath, her eyes bleared, and alwayes running, the complexion
of her face betweene greene and yellow, as if shee had not spent the
Summer season in the Citie, but in the parching Countrey under a
hedge; and beside all these excellent parts, shee was crooke backt,
poult footed, and went like a lame Mare in Fetters. Her name was
<i>Ciuta</i>, but in regard of her flat nose, lying as low as a Beagles, shee
was called <i>Ciutazza</i>. Now, notwithstanding all this deformity in
her, yet she had a singuler opinion of her selfe, as commonly all such
foule Sluts have: in regard whereof, Madame <i>Piccarda</i> calling her
aside, Thus began.</p>

<p><i>Ciutazza</i>, if thou wilt doe for me one nights service, I shall bestow on
thee a faire new Smocke. When <i>Ciutazza</i> heard her speake of a
new Smocke, instantly she answered. Madame, if you please to bestow
a new Smocke on me, were it to runne thorow the fire for you, or any
businesse of farre greater danger, you onely have the power to command
me, and I will doe it. I will not (said <i>Piccarda</i>) urge thee to
any dangerous action, but onely to lodge in my bed this night with a
man, and give him courteous entertainement, who shall reward thee
liberally for it. But have an especiall care that thou speake not one
word, for feare thou shouldst be heard by my Brethren, who (as thou
knowest) lodge so neere by: doe this, and then demaund thy Smocke of
me. Madame (quoth <i>Ciutazza</i>) if it were to lye with sixe men, rather
then one; if you say the word, it shall be done.</p>

<p>When night was come, the Provoste also came according to appointment,
even when the two brethren were in their lodging,
where they easily heard his entrance, as <i>Piccarda</i> (being present
with them) had informed them. In went the Provoste without any
candle, or making the least noise to be heard, &amp; being in <i>Piccardaes</i>
Chamber, went to bed: <i>Ciutazza</i> tarrying not long from him, but
(as her Mistresse had instructed her) she went to bed likewise, not
speaking any word at all, and the Provoste, imagining to have her
there, whom he so highly affected, fell to imbracing and kissing <i>Ciutazza</i>,
who was as forward in the same manner to him, and there for
a while I intend to leave them.</p>

<p>When <i>Piccarda</i> had performed this hot piece of businesse, she referred
the effecting of the remainder to her Brethren, in such sort as
it was compacted betweene them. Faire and softly went the two
brethren forth of their Chamber, and going to the Market place,
Fortune was more favourable to them then they could wish, in accomplishing
the issue of their intent. For the heat being somwhat tedious,
the Lord Bishop was walking abroad very late, with purpose
to visit the Brethren at the Widdowes house, because he tooke great
delight in their company, as being good Schollers, and endued with
other singular parts beside. Meeting with them in the open Market
place, he acquainted them with his determination; whereof they
were not a little joyfull, it jumping so justly with their intent.</p>

<p>Being come to the Widdowes house, they passed through a small
nether Court, where lights stood ready to welcome him thither;
and entring into a goodly Hall, there was store of good wine and
banquetting, which the Bishop accepted in very thankefull manner:
and courteous complement being overpassed, one of the Brethren,
thus spake. My good Lord, seeing it hath pleased you to honour our
poore Widdowed Sisters house with your presence, for which wee shall
thanke you while we live: We would intreate one favour more of you,
onely but to see a sight which we will shew you. The Lord Bishop was
well contented with the motion: so the Brethren conducting him
by the hand, brought him into their Sisters Chamber, where the
the Provoste was in bed with <i>Ciutazza</i>, both soundly sleeping, but
enfolded in his armes, as wearied (belike) with their former wantonning,
and whereof his age had but little need.</p>

<p>The Courtaines being close drawne about the bed, although the
season was exceeding hot, they having lighted Torches in their
hands; drew open the Curtaines, and shewed the Bishop his Provoste,
close snugging betweene the armes of <i>Ciutazza</i>. Upon a
sudden the Provoste awaked, and seeing so great a light, as also so
many people about him: shame and feare so daunted him, that hee
shrunke downe into the bed, and hid his head. But the Bishop being
displeased at a sight so unseemely, made him to discover his head
againe, to see whom he was in bed withall. Now the poore Provoste
perceiving the Gentlewomans deceite, and the proper hansome
person so sweetly embracing him: it made him so confounded
with shame, as he had not the power to utter one word: but
having put on his cloathes by the Bishops command, hee sent him
(under sufficient guard) to his Pallace, to suffer due chastisement for
his sinne committed; and afterward he desired to know, by what
meanes hee became so favoured of <i>Ciutazza</i>, the whole Historie
whereof, the two brethren related at large to him.</p>

<p>When the Bishop had heard all the discourse, highly he commended
the wisedome of the Gentlewoman, and worthy assistance of
her brethren, who contemning to soile their hands in the blood of a
Priest, rather sought to shame him as hee deserved. The Bishop
enjoyned him a pennance of repentance for forty dayes after, but
love and disdaine made him weepe nine and forty: Moreover, it
was a long while after, before he durst be seene abroad. But when
he came to walke the streets, the Boyes would point their fingers at
him, saying. Behold the Provoste that lay with <i>Ciutazza</i>: Which
was such a wearisome life to him, that he became (well neere) distracted
in his wits. In this manner the honest Gentlewoman discharged
her dutie, and rid her selfe of the Provosts importunity:
<i>Ciutazza</i> had a merry night of it, and a new Smocke also for her labour.</p>

to the Marquesate of</i> Ancona) <i>at</i> Florence, <i>at such time as
he sate on the Bench, and hearing criminall causes.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Fift Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Giving admonition, that for the managing of publique affaires, no other
persons are or ought to be appointed, but such as be honest, and
meet to sit on the seate of Authority.</i></h4>


<p>No sooner had Madam <i>Æmillia</i> finished her Novell, wherein,
the excellent wisedome of <i>Piccarda</i>, for so worthily
punishing the luxurious old Provoste, had generall commendations
of the whole Assembly: but the Queene, looking on
<i>Philostratus</i>, said. I command you next to supply the place: whereto
he made answere, that hee was both ready and willing, and then
thus began. Honourable Ladies, the merry Gentleman, so lately remembred
by Madame <i>Eliza</i>, being named <i>Maso del Saggio</i>; causeth
me to passe over an intended Tale, which I had resolved on when it came
to my turne: to report another concerning him, and two men more,
his friendly Companions, which although it may appeare to you somewhat
unpleasing, in regard of a little grosse and unmannerly behaviour:
yet it will move merriment without any offence, and that is the
maine reason why I relate it.</p>

<p>It is not unknowne to you, partly by intelligence from our reverend
predecessours, as also some understanding of your owne, that
many time have resorted to our City of <i>Florence</i>, Potestates and
Officers, belonging to the Marquesate of <i>Anconia</i>; who commonly
were men of lowe spirit, and their lives so wretched and penurious,
as they rather deserved to be tearmed Misers, then men. And in
regard of this their naturall covetousnesse and misery, the Judges
would bring also in their company, such Scribes or Notaries, as being
paralelde with their Masters: they all seemed like Swaines come
from the Plough, or bred up in some Coblers quality, rather then
Schollers, or Students of Law.</p>

<p>At one time (above all the rest) among other Potestates and Judges,
there came an especiall man, as pickt out of purpose, who was
named <i>Messer Niccolao da San Lepidio</i>, who (at the first beholding)
looked rather like a Tinker, then any Officer in authority. This
hansome man (among the rest) was deputed to heare criminall
causes. And, as often it happeneth, that Citizens, although no businesse
inviteth them to Judiciall Courts, yet they still resort thither,
sometimes accidentally: So it fortuned, that <i>Maso del Saggio</i>, being
one morning in search of an especiall friend, went to the Court-house,
and being there, observed in what manner <i>Messer Niccolao</i>
was seated; who looking like some strange Fowle, lately come forth
of a farre Countrey; he began to survay him the more seriously,
even from the head to the foot, as we use to say.</p>

<p>And albeit he saw his Gowne furred with Miniver, as also the
hood about his necke, a Penne and Inkehorne hanging at his girdle,
and one skirt of his Garment longer then the other, with more misshapen
sights about him, farre unfitting for a man of so civill profession:
yet he spyed one error extraordinary, the most notable (in
his opinion) that ever he had seene before. Namely, a paultry paire
of Breeches, wickedly made, and worse worne, hanging downe so
lowe as halfe his legge, even as he sate upon the Bench, yet cut so
sparingly of the Cloath, that they gaped wide open before, as a
wheele-barrow might have full entrance allowed it. This strange
sight was so pleasing to him; as leaving off further search of his
friend, and scorning to have such a spectacle alone by himselfe: hee
went upon another Inquisition; Namely, for two other merry
Lads like himselfe, the one being called <i>Ribi</i>, and the other <i>Matteuzzo</i>,
men of the same mirth-full disposition as he was, and therefore
the fitter for his Company.</p>

<p>After he had met with them, these were his salutations: My honest
Boyes, if ever you did me any kindnesse, declare it more effectually now,
in accompanying me to the Court-house, where you shall behold such
a singular spectacle, as (I am sure) you never yet saw the like. Forthwith
they went along altogether, and being come to the Court-house, he
shewed them the Judges hansome paire of Breeches, hanging down
in such base and beastly manner; that (being as yet farre off from
the Bench) their hearts did ake with extreamity of laughter. But
when they came neere to the seat whereon <i>Messer Niccolao</i> sate,
they plainely perceived, that it was very easie to be crept under, and
withall, that the board whereon he set his feet, was rotten and broken,
so that it was no difficult matter, to reach it, and pull it downe
as a man pleased, and let him fall bare Breecht to the ground.
Cheare up your spirits (my hearts) quoth <i>Maso</i>, and if your longing be
like to mine; we will have yonder Breeches a good deale lower, for I see
how it may be easily done.</p>

<p>Laying their heads together, plotting and contriving severall
wayes, which might be the likelyest to compasse their intent: each
of them had his peculiar appointment, to undertake the businesse
without fayling, and it was to be performed the next morning. At
the houre assigned, they met there againe, and finding the Court
well filled with people, the Plaintiffes and Defendants earnestly
pleading: <i>Matteuzzo</i> (before any body could descry him) was cunningly
crept under the Bench, and lay close by the board whereon
the Judge placed his feete. Then stept in <i>Maso</i> on the right hand
of <i>Messer Niccolao</i>, and tooke fast hold on his Gowne before; the
like did <i>Ribi</i> on the left hand, in all respects answerable to the other.
Oh my Lord Judge (cryed <i>Maso</i> out aloud) I humbly intreat you for
charities sake, before this pilfering knave escape away from hence; that
I may have Justice against him, for stealing my drawing-over stockeings,
which he stoutly denyeth, yet mine owne eyes beheld the deed, it
being now not above fifteene dayes since, when first I bought them for
mine owne use.</p>

<p>Worthy Lord Judge (cryed <i>Ribi</i>, on the other side) doe not beleeve
what he saith, for he is a paltry lying fellow, and because hee knew I
came hither to make my complaint for a Male or Cloakebag which he
stole from me: hee urgeth this occasion for a paire of drawing Stockeings,
which he delivered me with his owne hands. If your Lordship
will not credit me, I can produce as witnesses, <i>Trecco</i> the Shoemaker,
with <i>Monna Grassa</i> the Souse-seller, and he that sweepes the Church
of <i>Santa Maria a Verzaia</i>, who saw him when he came posting hither.
<i>Maso</i> haling and tugging the Judge by the sleeve, would not suffer
him to heare <i>Ribi</i>, but cryed out still for Justice against him, as he did
the like on the contrary side.</p>

<p>During the time of this their clamourous contending, the Judge
being very willing to heare either party: <i>Matteuzzo</i>, upon a
signe received from the other, which was a word in <i>Masoes</i> pleading,
laide holde on the broken boord, as also on the Judges low-hanging
Breech, plucking at them both so strongly, that they fell
downe immediately, the Breeches being onely tyed but with one
Poynt before. He hearing the boards breaking underneath him, and
such maine pulling at his Breeches; strove (as he sate) to make them
fast before, but the Poynt being broken, and <i>Maso</i> crying in his eare
on the one side, as <i>Ribi</i> did the like in the other; hee was at his
wits end to defend himselfe. My Lord (quoth <i>Maso</i>) you may bee ashamed
that you doe me not Justice, why will you not heare mee, but
wholly lend your eare to mine Adversary? My Lord (said <i>Ribi</i>) never
was Libell preferd into this Court, of such a paltry trifling matter, and
therefore I must, and will have Justice.</p>

<p>By this time the Judge was dismounted from the Bench, and
stood on the ground, with his slovenly Breeches hanging about his
heeles; <i>Matteuzzo</i> being cunningly stolne away, and undiscovered
by anybody. <i>Ribi</i>, thinking he had shamed the Judge sufficiently,
went away, protesting, that he would declare his cause in the hearing
of a wiser Judge. And <i>Maso</i> forbearing to tugge his Gowne
any longer, in his departing, said. Fare you well Sir, you are not worthy
to be a Magistrate, if you have no more regard of your honour and
honesty, but will put off poore mens suites at your pleasure. So both
went severall wayes, and soone were gone out of publike view.</p>

<p>The worshipfull Judge <i>Messer Niccolao</i> stood all this while on
the ground; and, in presence of all the beholders, trussed up his
Breeches, as if hee were new risen out of his bed: when better bethinking
himselfe on the matters indifference, he called for the two
men, who contended for the drawing stockings and the Cloake-bag;
but no one could tell what was become of them. Whereupon,
he rapt out a kinde of Judges oath, saying: I will know whether
it be Law or no heere in <i>Florence</i>, to make a Judge sit bare
Breecht on the Bench of Justice, and in the hearing of criminall
Causes; whereat the chiefe Potestate, and all the standers by laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>Within fewe dayes after, he was informed by some of his especiall
Friends, that this had never happened to him, but onely to testifie,
how understanding the <i>Florentines</i> are, in their ancient constitutions
and customes, to embrace, love and honour, honest, discreet
worthy Judges and Magistrates; Whereas on the contrary,
they as much condemne miserable knaves, fooles, and dolts, who
never merit to have any better entertainment. Wherefore, it would
be best for him, to make no more enquiry after the parties; lest a
worse inconvenience should happen to him.</p>

meanes whereof they made him beleeve, that hee had robde himselfe.
And for feare they should report this theft to his wife; they made him
to goe buy another Brawne.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Sixt Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is declared, how easily a plaine and simple man may be made a
foole, when he dealeth with crafty companions.</i></h4>


<p><i>Philostratus</i> had no sooner concluded his Novell, and the
whole Assembly laughed heartily thereat: but the Queen
gave command to Madame <i>Philomena</i>, that shee should
follow next in order; whereupon thus shee began. Worthy Ladies,
as <i>Philostratus</i>, by calling to memorie the name of <i>Maso del Saggio</i>,
hath contented you with another merry Novell concerning him: in the
same manner must I intreat you, to remember once againe <i>Calandrino</i>
and his subtle Consorts, by a pretty tale which I meane to tell you; how,
and in what manner they were revenged on him, for going to seeke the
invisible Stone.</p>

<p>Needlesse were any fresh relation to you, what manner of people
those three men were, <i>Calandrino, Bruno,</i> and <i>Buffalmaco,</i> because
already you have had sufficient understanding of them. And
therefore, as an induction to my discourse, I must tell you, that <i>Calandrino</i>
had a small Country-house, in a Village some-what neere
to <i>Florence</i>, which came to him by the marriage of his Wife. Among
other Cattle and Poultry, which he kept there in store, hee
had a young Boare readie fatted for Brawne, whereof yearly he used
to kill one for his owne provision; and alwaies in the month of
December, he and his wife resorted to their village house, to have
a Brawne both killed and salted.</p>

<p>It came to passe at this time concerning my Tale, that the Woman
being somewhat crazie and sickly, by her Husbands unkinde
usage, whereof you heard so lately; <i>Calandrino</i> went alone to the
killing of his Boare, which comming to the hearing of <i>Bruno</i> and
<i>Buffalmaco</i>, and that the Woman could by no meanes be there: to
passe away the time a little in merriment, they went to a friendlie
Companion of theirs, an honest joviall Priest, dwelling not farre
off from <i>Calandrinoes</i> Countrey house.</p>

<p>The same morning as the Boare was kilde, they all three went
thither, and <i>Calandrino</i> seeing them in the Priests companie: bad
them all heartily welcome; and to acquaint them with his good
Husbandry, hee shewed them his house, and the Boare where it
hung. They perceyving it to be faire and fat, knowing also, that
<i>Calandrino</i> intended to salt it for his owne store, <i>Bruno</i> saide unto
him: Thou art an Asse <i>Calandrino</i>, sell thy Brawne, and let us make
merrie with the money: then let thy wife know no otherwise, but that
it was stolne from thee, by those theeves which continually haunt country
houses, especially in such scattering Villages.</p>

<p>Oh mine honest friends, answered <i>Calandrino</i>, your counsell is not
to be followed, neither is my wife so easie to be perswaded: this were the
readiest way to make your house a hell, and she to become the Master-Divell:
therefore talke no further, for flatly I will not doe it. Albeit
they laboured him very earnestly, yet all proved not to anie purpose:
onely he desired them to suppe with him, but in so colde a
manner, as they denyed him, and parted thence from him. As they
walked on the way, <i>Bruno</i> saide to <i>Buffalmaco</i>. Shall we three (this
night) rob him of his Brawne? Yea marry (quoth <i>Buffalmaco</i>) how
is it to be done? I have (saide <i>Bruno</i>) alreadie found the meanes to effect
it, if he take it not from the place where last we saw it. Let us doe
it then (answered <i>Buffalmaco</i>) why should we not do it? Sir Domine
heere and we, will make good cheare with it among our selves. The
nimble Priest was as forward as the best; and the match being fully
agreed on, <i>Bruno</i> thus spake. My delicate Sir Domine, Art and
cunning must be our maine helps: for thou knowest <i>Buffalmaco</i>, what
a covetous wretch <i>Calandrino</i> is, glad and readie to drink alwaies on
other mens expences: let us go take him with us to the Tavern, where
the Priest (for his owne honour and reputation) shall offer to make paiment
of the whole reckoning, without receiving a farthing of his,
whereof he will not be a little joyfull, so shall we bring to passe the rest
of the businesse, because there is no body in the house, but onely himselfe:
for he is best at ease without company.</p>

<p>As <i>Bruno</i> had propounded, so was it accordingly performed, &amp;
when <i>Calandrino</i> perceyved, that the Priest would suffer none to
pay, but himselfe, he dranke the more freely; and when there was
no neede at all, tooke his Cuppes couragiously, one after another.
Two or three houres of the night were spent, before they parted
from the Taverne, <i>Calandrino</i> going directly home to his house,
and instantly to bed, without any other supper, imagining that he
had made fast his doore, which (indeede) he left wide open: sleeping
soundly, without suspition of any harme intended unto him.
<i>Buffalmaco</i> and <i>Bruno</i> went and supt with the Priest, and so soone as
supper was ended, they tooke certaine Engines, for their better entering
into <i>Calandrinoes</i> house, and so went on to effect theyr purpose.
Finding the doore standing readie open, they entered in,
tooke the Brawne, carried it with them to the Priests house, and afterward
went all to bed.</p>

<p>When <i>Calandrino</i> had well slept after his Wine, he arose in the
morning, and being descended downe the staires, finding the street
doore wide open, he looked for the Brawne, but it was gone. Enquiring
of the neighbours dwelling neere about him, hee could
heare no tydings of his Brawne, but became the wofullest man in
the world, telling every one that his Brawne was stolne. <i>Bruno</i> and
<i>Buffalmaco</i> being risen in the morning, they went to visite <i>Calandrino</i>,
to heare how he tooke the losse of his Brawne: and hee no
sooner had a sight of them, but he called them to him; and with the
teares running downe his cheekes, sayde: Ah my deare friendes, I
am robde of my Brawne. <i>Bruno</i> stepping closely to him, sayde in his
eare: It is wonderfull, that once in thy life time thou canst bee wise.
How? answered <i>Calandrino</i>, I speake to you in good earnest. Speake so
still in earnest (replied <i>Bruno</i>) and cry it out so loud as thou canst, then
let who list beleeve it to be true.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> stampt and fretted exceedingly, saying: As I am a
true man to God, my Prince, and Countrey, I tell thee truly, that my
Brawne is stolne. Say so still I bid thee (answered <i>Bruno</i>) and let all
the world beleeve thee, if they list to do so, for I will not. Wouldst thou,
(quoth <i>Calandrino</i>) have me damne my selfe to the divell? I see thou
dost not credit what I say: but would I were hanged by the necke, if it
be not true, that my Brawne is stolne. How can it possible be, replyed
<i>Bruno</i>? Did not I see it in thy house yesternight? Wouldst thou have
me beleeve, that it is flowne away? Although it is not flowne away
(quoth <i>Calandrino</i>) yet I am certain, that it is stolne away: for which
I am weary of my life, because I dare not go home to mine owne house,
in regard my wife will never beleeve it; and yet if she should credite it,
we are sure to have no peace for a twelvemonths space.</p>

<p><i>Bruno</i>, seeming as if he were more then halfe sorrowfull, yet supporting
still his former jesting humor, saide: Now trust mee <i>Calandrino</i>,
if it be so; they that did it are much too blame. If it be so? answered
<i>Calandrino</i>, Belike thou wouldst have mee blaspheme Heaven,
and all the Saints therein: I tell thee once againe <i>Bruno</i>, that this
last night my Brawne was stolne. Be patient good <i>Calandrino</i>, replyed
<i>Buffalmaco</i>, and if thy Brawne be stolne from thee, there are means
enow to get it againe. Meanes enow to get it againe? said <i>Calandrino</i>,
I would faine heare one likely one, and let all the rest go by. I am
sure <i>Calandrino</i>, answered <i>Buffalmaco</i>, thou art verily perswaded,
that no Theefe came from <i>India</i>, to steale thy Brawne from thee: in
which respect, it must needes then be some of thy Neighbours: whom
if thou couldst lovingly assemble together, I knowe an experiment to
be made with Bread and Cheese, whereby the party that hath it, will
quickly be discovered.</p>

<p>I have heard (quoth <i>Bruno</i>) of such an experiment, and helde it
to be infallible; but it extendeth onely unto persons of Gentilitie,
whereof there are but few dwelling heere about, and in the case of
stealing a Brawne, it is doubtfull to invite them, neither can there
be any certainty of their comming. I confesse what you say, aunswered
<i>Buffalmaco</i>, to be very true: but then in this matter, so nerely
concerning us to be done, and for a deare Friend, what is your
advice? I would have Pilles made of Ginger, compounded with
your best and strongest <i>Malmesey</i>, then let the ordinary sort of people
be invited (for such onely are most to be mistrusted) and they
will not faile to come, because they are utterly ignorant of our intention.
Besides, the Pilles may as well bee hallowed and consecrated,
as bread and cheese on the like occasion. Indeede you say
true (replyed <i>Buffalmaco</i>) but what is the opinion of <i>Calandrino</i>?
Is he willing to have this tryall made, or no? Yes, by all meanes,
answered <i>Calandrino</i>, for gladly I would know who hath stolne
my Brawne, and your good words have (more then halfe) comforted
me already in this case.</p>

<p>Well then (quoth <i>Bruno</i>) I will take the paines to go to <i>Florence</i>, to
provide all things necessarie for this secret service; but I must bee furnished
with money to effect it. <i>Calandrino</i> had some forty shillings
then about him, which he delivered to <i>Bruno</i>, who presently went
to <i>Florence</i>, to a friend of his an Apothecarie, of whom he bought
a pound of white Ginger, which hee caused him to make uppe in
small Pilles: and two other beside of a Dogges-dates or Dowsets,
confected all over with strong Aloes, yet well moulded in Sugare,
as all the rest were: and because they should the more easily bee
knowne from the other, they were spotted with Gold, in verie formall
and Physicall manner. He bought moreover, a big Flaggon
of the best Malmesey, returning backe with all these things to <i>Calandrino</i>,
and directing him in this order.</p>

<p>You must put some friend in trust, to invite your Neighbors (especially
such as you suspect) to a breakfast in the morning: and because it
is done as a feast in kindnesse, they will come to you the more willingly.
This night will I and <i>Buffalmaco</i> take such order, that the Pilles
shall have the charge imposed on them, and then wee will bring them
hither againe in the morning: and I my selfe (for your sake) will deliver
them to your guests, and performe whatsoever is to bee sayde or
done. On the next morning, a goodly company being assembled,
under a faire Elme before the Church; as well young <i>Florentynes</i>
(who purposely came to make themselves merry) as neighbouring
Husbandmen of the Village: <i>Bruno</i> was to begin the service, with
the Pils in a faire Cup, and <i>Buffalmaco</i> followed him with another
Cup, to deliver the wine out of the Flaggon, all the company beeing
set round, as in a circle; and <i>Bruno</i> with <i>Buffalmaco</i> being in the
midst of them, <i>Bruno</i> thus spake.</p>

<p>Honest friends, it is fit that I should acquaint you with the occasion,
why we are thus met together, and in this place: because if anie thing
may seeme offensive to you; afterward you shall make no complaint of
me. From <i>Calandrino</i> (our loving friend heere present) yesternight
there was a new-kild fat Brawne taken, but who hath done the deede,
as yet he knoweth not; and because none other, but some one (or more)
heere among us, must needs offend in this case: he, desiring to understand
who they be, would have each man to receive one of these Pilles,
and afterward to drinke of this Wine; assuring you all, that whosoever
stole the Brawne hence, cannot be able to swallow the Pill: for it wil be
so extreme bitter in his mouth, as it will enforce him to Coughe and
spet extraordinarily. In which respect, before such a notorious shame
be received, and in so goodly an assembly, as now are heere present: it
were much better for him or them that have the Brawne, to confesse it
in private to this honest Priest, and I will abstaine from urging anie
such publike proofe.</p>

<p>Every one there present answered, that they were well contented
both to eate and drinke, and let the shame fall where it deserved;
whereupon, <i>Bruno</i> appointing them how they should sit, and
placing <i>Calandrino</i> as one among them: he began his counterfeite
exorcisme, giving each man a Pill, and <i>Buffalmaco</i> a Cup of Wine
after it. But when he came to <i>Calandrino</i>, hee tooke one of them,
which was made of the Dogges dates or Dowsets, and delivering
it into his hand, presently hee put it into his mouth and chewed it.
So soone as his tongue tasted the bitter Aloes, he began to coughe
and spet extreamly, as being utterly unable, to endure the bitternesse
and noysome smell. The other men that had receyved the
Pils, beganne to gaze one upon another, to see whose behaviour
should discover him; and <i>Bruno</i> having not (as yet) delivered Pils
to them all, proceeded on still in his businesse, as seeming not to
heare any coughing, till one behinde him, saide. What meaneth
<i>Calandrino</i> by this spetting and coughing?</p>

<p><i>Bruno</i> sodainely turning him about, and seeing <i>Calandrino</i> to
cough and spet in such sort, saide to the rest. Be not too rash (honest
Friends) in judging of any man, some other matter (then the Pille)
may procure this Coughing, wherefore he shall receive another, the better
to cleare your beleefe concerning him. He having put the second
prepared Pill into his mouth, while <i>Bruno</i> went to serve the rest of
the Guests: if the first was exceeding bitter to his taste, this other
made it a great deale worse, for teares streamed forth of his eyes as
bigge as Cherry-stones, and champing and chewing the Pill, as hoping
it would overcome his coughing; he coughed and spette the
more violently, and in grosser manner then he did before, nor did
they give him any wine to helpe it.</p>

<p><i>Buffalmaco, Bruno,</i> and the whole company, perceiving how he
continued still his coughing and spetting; saide all with one voyce,
That <i>Calandrino</i> was the Theefe to himselfe: and gave him manie
grosse speeches beside, all departing home into their houses, very
much displeased and angry with him. After they were gone, none
remained with him but the Priest, <i>Bruno</i> and <i>Buffalmaco</i>, who thus
spake to <i>Calandrino</i>. I did ever thinke, that thou wast the theefe thy
selfe, yet thou imputedst thy robbery to some other, for feare we should
once drinke freely of thy purse, as thou hast done many times of ours.
<i>Calandrino</i>, who had not yet ended his coughing and spetting,
sware many bitter Oathes, that his Brawne was stolne from him.
Talke so long as thou wilt, quoth <i>Buffalmaco</i>, thy knavery is both
knowne and seene, and well thou mayst be ashamed of thy selfe. <i>Calandrino</i>
hearing this, grew desperately angry; and to incense him
more, <i>Bruno</i> thus pursued the matter.</p>

<p>Hear me <i>Calandrino</i>, for I speake to thee in honest earnest, there
was a man in the company, who did eate and drinke heere among thy
neighbours, and plainly told me, that thou keptst a young Lad heere to
do thee service, feeding him with such victuals as thou couldst spare,
by him thou didst send away thy Brawne, to one that bought it of thee
for foure Crownes, onely to cousen thy poore wife and us. Canst thou
not yet learne to leave thy mocking and scorning? Thou hast forgotte,
how thou broughtst us to the plaine of <i>Mugnone</i>, to seeke for black invisible
stones: which having found, thou concealedst them to thy selfe,
stealing home invisibly before us, and making us follow like fooles after
thee.</p>

<p>Now likewise, by horrible lying Oathes, and perjured protestations,
thou wouldst make us to beleeve, that the Brawne (which thou hast
cunningly sold for ready money) was stolne from thee out of thy house,
when thou art onely the Theefe to thy selfe, as by that excellent rule of
Art (which never faileth) hath plainly, to thy shame, appeared. Wee
being so well acquainted with thy delusions, and knowing them perfectly;
now do plainly tell thee, that we mean not to be foold any more.
Nor is it unknowne to thee, what paines wee have taken, in making
this singular peece of proofe. Wherefore we inflict this punishment on
thee, that thou shalt bestow on this honest Priest and us, two couple of
Capons, and a Flaggon of Wine, or else we will discover this knavery of
thine to thy Wife.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> perceiving, that all his protestations could winne no
credit with them, who had now the Law remaining in their owne
hands, and purposed to deale with him as they pleased: apparently
saw, that sighing and sorrow did nothing availe him. Moreover,
to fall into his wives tempestuous stormes of chiding, would bee
worse to him then racking or torturing: he gladly therefore gave
them money, to buy the two couple of Capons and Wine, being
heartily contented likewise, that hee was so well delivered from
them. So the merry Priest, <i>Bruno</i>, and <i>Buffalmaco</i>, having taken
good order for salting the Brawne; closely carried it with them to
<i>Florence</i>, leaving <i>Calandrino</i> to complaine of his losse, and well requited,
for mocking them with the invisible stones.</p>

Helena, <i>she being a Widdow, and addicted in affection to another
Gentleman. One whole night in cold winter, she caused the Scholler
to expect her comming, in an extreame frost and snow. In revenge
whereof, by his imagined Art and skill, he made her to stand
naked on the top of a Tower, the space of a whole day, and in the hot
moneth of July, to be Sun-burnt and bitten with Waspes and Flies.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Seventh Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Serving as an admonition to all Ladies and Gentlewomen, not to mock
or scorne Gentlemen-Schollers, when they make meanes of love to
them; Except they intend to seeke their owne shame, by disgracing
them.</i></h4>


<p>Greatly did the Ladies commend Madame <i>Philomenaes</i>
Novell, laughing heartily at poore <i>Calandrino</i>, yet grieving
withall, that he should be so knavishly cheated, not
onely of his Brawne, but two couple of Capons, and a Flaggon of
Wine beside. But the whole discourse being ended; the Queene
commanded Madame <i>Pampinea</i>, to follow next with her Novell,
and presently she thus began. It hapneth oftentimes, (bright beauties)
that mockery falleth onto him, that intended the same unto another:
And therefore I am of opinion, that there is very little wisedom
declared on him or her, who taketh delight in mocking any person.
I must needs confesse, that we have smiled at many mockeries and deceits,
related in those excellent Novels, which we have already heard;
without any due revenge returned, but onely in this last of silly <i>Calandrino</i>.
Wherefore, it is now my determination, to urge a kind of compassionate
apprehension, upon a very just retribution, happening to a
Gentlewoman of our Citie, because her scorne fell deservedly upon her
selfe, remaining mocked, and to the perill of her life. Let me then assure
you, that your diligent attention may redound to your benefit, because
if you keepe your selves (henceforward) from being scorned by others:
you shall expresse the greater wisedome, and be the better warned
by their mishaps.</p>

<p>As yet there are not many yeares over-past, since there dwelt in
<i>Florence</i>, a young Lady, descended of Noble parentage, very beautifull,
of sprightly courage, and sufficiently abounding in the goods
of Fortune, she being named Madame <i>Helena</i>. Her delight was
to live in the estate of Widdow-hood, desiring to match her selfe
no more in marriage, because she bare affection to a gallant young
Gentleman, whom she had made her private election of, and with
whom (having excluded all other amorous cares and cogitations)
by meanes of her Waiting-woman, she had divers meetings, and
kinde conferences.</p>

<p>It chanced at the verie same time, another young Gentleman of
our Citie, called <i>Reniero</i>, having long studied in the Schooles at
<i>Paris</i>, returned home to <i>Florence</i>, not to make sale of his Learning
and experience, as many doe: but to understand the reason of
things, as also the causes and effects of them, which is mervailously
fitting for any Gentleman. Being greatly honoured and esteemed
of everyone, as well for his courteous carriage towards all in
generall, as for his knowledge and excellent parts: he lived more
like a familiar Citizen, then in the nature of a Courtly Gentleman,
albeit he was choisely respected in either estate.</p>

<p>But, as oftentimes it commeth to passe, that such as are endued
with the best judgement and understanding in naturall occasions,
are soonest caught and intangled in the snares of Love: so fel it out
with our Scholler <i>Reniero</i>, who being invited to a solemne Feast,
in company of other his especiall Friends; this Lady <i>Helena</i>, attyred
in her blacke Garments (as Widowes commonly use to wear)
was likewise there a Guest. His eye observing her beauty and gracious
demeanour, she seemed in his judgement, to be a Woman so
compleate and perfect, as he had never seene her equall before: &amp;
therefore, he accounted the man more then fortunate, that was
worthy to embrace her in his armes. Continuing this amorous observation
of her from time to time, and knowing withall, that rare
and excellent things are not easily obtained, but by painefull study,
labour, and endeavour: hee resolved with himselfe constantly, to
put in practise all his best parts of industry, onely to honour and
please her, and attaining to her contentation, it would be the means
to winne her love, and compasse thereby his hearts desire.</p>

<p>The young Lady, who fixed not her eyes on inferiour subjects (but
esteemed her selfe above ordinary reach or capacity) could moove
them artificially, as curious women well know how to doe, looking
on every side about her, yet not in a gadding or grosse manner;
for she was not ignorant in such darting glaunces, as proceeded
from an enflamed affection, which appearing plainely in <i>Reniero</i>;
with a pretty smile, shee said to her selfe. I am not come hither this
day in vaine; for, if my judgement faile me not, I thinke I have caught
a Woodcocke by the Bill. And lending him a cunning looke or two,
queintly caried with the corner of her eye; she gave him a kinde of
perswading apprehension, that her heart was the guide to her eye.
And in this artificiall Schoole-tricke of hers, shee carryed therewith
another consideration, to wit, that the more other eyes fedde themselves
on her perfections, and were (well-neere) lost in them beyond
recovery: so much the greater reason had he to account his
fortune beyond comparison, that was the sole master of her heart,
and had her love at his command.</p>

<p>Our witty Scholler having set aside his Philosophicall considerations,
strove how he might best understand her carriage toward
him, and beleeving that she beheld him with pleasing regards; hee
learned to know the house where shee dwelt, passing daily by the
doore divers times, under colour of some more serious occasions:
wherein the Lady very proudly gloried, in regard of the reasons before
alleadged, and seemed to affoord him lookes of good liking.
Being led thus with a hopefull perswasion, hee founde the meanes to
gaine acquaintance with her waiting-woman, revealing to her his
intire affection, desiring her to worke for him in such sort with her
Lady, that his service might be gracious in her acceptance. The
Gentlewoman made him a very willing promise, and immediately
did his errand to her Lady; who heard her with no small pride and
squemishnesse, and breaking forth into a scornefull laughter, thus
she spake.</p>

<p><i>Ancilla</i> (for so she was named) dost thou not observe, how this Scholler
is come to lose all the wit heere, which he has studyed so long for in the
University of <i>Paris</i>? Let us make him our onely Table argument, and
seeing his folly soareth so high, we will feed him with such a dyet as hee
deserveth. Yet when thou speakest next with him, tell him, that I affect
him more then he can doe me: but it becommeth me to be carefull
of mine honour, and to walke with an untainted brow, as other Ladies
and Gentlewomen doe: which he is not to mislike, if he be so wise as he
maketh shew of, but rather will the more commend me. Alas good
Lady lack-wit, little did she understand (faire assembly) how dangerous
a case it is to deale with Schollers.</p>

<p>At his next meeting with the waiting woman, shee delivered the
message, as her Lady had command her, whereof poore <i>Reniero</i> was
so joyfull: that hee pursued his love-suite the more earnestly, and
began to write letters, send gifts, and tokens, all which were still received,
yet without any other answere to give hope, but onely in
generall, and thus shee dallied with him a long while. In the end,
she discovered this matter to her secret chosen friend, who fell suddenly
sicke of the head-ake, onely through meere conceit of jealousie:
which she perceiving, and grieving to be suspected without any
cause, especially by him whom shee esteemed above all other; shee
intended to rid him quickely of that Idle disease. And being more
and more solicited by the Scholler, she sent him word by her maide
<i>Ancilla</i>, that (as yet) she could find no convenient opportunity, to
yeeld him such assurance, as hee should not any way be distrustfull
of her love.</p>

<p>But the Feast of Christmas was now neere at hand, which afforded
leisures much more hopefull, then any other formerly passed.
And therefore, the next night after the first Feasting day, if he pleased
to walke in the open Court of her house: she would soone send
for him, into a place much better beseeming, and where they might
freely converse together.</p>

<p>Now was our Scholler the onely jocond man of the world, and
failed not the time assigned him, but went unto the Ladies house,
where <i>Ancilla</i> was ready to give him entertainment, conducting
him into the base Court, where she lockt him up fast, untill her Lady
should send for him. This night shee had privately sent for her
friend also, and sitting merrily at supper with him, told him, what
welcome she had given the Scholler, and how she further meant to
use him, saying. Now Sir, consider with yourselfe, what hot affection
I beare to him, of whom you became so fondly jealous. The which
words were very welcome to him, and made him extraordinarily
joyful; desiring to see them as effectually performed, as they appeared
to him by her protestations.</p>

<p>Heere you are to understand (Gracious Ladies) that according
to the season of the yeare, a great snow had falne the day before, so
as the whole Court was covered therewith, and being an extreame
frost upon it, our Scholler could not boast of any warme walking,
when the teeth quivered in his head with cold, as a Dog could not
be more discourteously used: yet hope of enjoying Loves recompence
at length, made him to support all this injury with admirable
patience.</p>

<p>Within a while after, Madame <i>Helena</i> said to her friend. Walke
with me (deare heart) into my Chamber, and there at a secret little
window, I shall shew thee what he doth, that drove thee to such a suspition
of me, and we shall heare beside, what answere he will give my maide
<i>Ancilla</i>, whom I will send to comfort him in his coldnesse.</p>

<p>When she had so said, they went to the appointed chamber window,
where they could easily see him, but he not them: and then
they heard <i>Ancilla</i> also, calling to him forth of another windowe,
saying. Signior <i>Reniero</i>, my Lady is the wofullest woman in the
world, because (as yet) she cannot come to you, in regard that one of
her brethren came this evening to visite her, and held her with much
longer discourse then she expected: whereby she was constrained to invite
him to sup with her, and yet he is not gone; but shortly I hope hee
will, and then expect her comming presently; till when, she entreateth
your gentle sufferance.</p>

<p>Poore <i>Reniero</i>, our over-credulous Scholler, whose vehement affection
to Madame <i>Helena</i>, so hood-winkt the sight of his understanding,
as he could not be distrustfull of any guilt; returned this
answere to <i>Ancilla</i>. Say to your Lady that I am bound in duty, to attend
the good houre of her leisure, without so much as the very least
prejudicate conceite in me: Neverthelesse, entreat her, to let it bee so
soone as she possibly may, because here is miserable walking, and it beginneth
againe to snow extreamely. <i>Ancilla</i> making fast the Casement,
went presently to bed; when <i>Helena</i> spake thus to her amorous
friend. What saist thou now? Doest thou thinke that I loved
him, as thou wast affraid of? if I did, he should never walke thus in the
frost and snow. So, away went they likewise from their close gazing
window, and spent wanton dalliances together, laughing, and deriding
(with many bitter taunts and jests) the lamentable condition
of poore <i>Reniero</i>.</p>

<p>About the Court walked hee numberlesse times, finding such
exercises as he could best devise, to compasse warmth in any manner:
no seate or shelter had he any where, either to ease himselfe by
sitting downe a while, or keepe him from the snow, falling continually
on him, which made him bestow many curses on the Ladies
Brother, for his so long tarrying with her, as beleeving him verily
to be in the house, else she would (long before) have admitted his
entrance, but therein his hope was meerely deceived. It grew now
to be about the houre of midnight, and <i>Helena</i> had delighted her
selfe with her friend extraordinarily, til at last she spake to him.
What is thine opinion of my amourous Scholler? Which dost thou imagine
to be the greatest, either his sense and judgement, or the affection
I beare to him? Is not this cold sufferance of this, able to quench the
violent heate of his loves extremitie, and having so much snow broth
to helpe it? Beleeve me (sweet Lady) quoth her friend, as hee is a
man, and a learned Scholler, I pitty that he should bee thus ungently
dealt withall: but as he is my rivall and loves enemy, I cannot allow
him the least compassion, resting the more confidently assured of your
love to me, which I will alwayes esteeme most precious.</p>

<p>When they had spent a long while in this or the like conference,
with infinite sweet kisses and embraces intermixed; then she began
againe in this manner. Deare love (quoth she) cast thy Cloake about
thee, as I intend to doe with my night mantle, and let us step to the
little window once more, to see whether the flaming fire, which burned
in the Schollers brest (as daily avouched to me in his love letters) be as
yet extinct or no. So going to the window againe, and looking
downe into the Court; there they saw the Scholler dancing in the
snow, to the cold tune of his teeths quivering and chattering, and
clapping his armes about his body, which was no pleasing melody
to him. How thinkest thou now sweet heart (saide shee) cannot I
make a man daunce without the sound of a Taber, or of a Bagpipe? Yes
beleeve me Lady (quoth he) I plaine perceive you can, and would be very
lothe, that you should exercise your cunning on me. Nay, said shee,
we will yet delight our selves a little more; let us softly descend downe
the stayres, even so farre as to the Court doore; thou shalt not speake a
word, but I will talke to him, and heare some part of his quivering
language, which cannot choose but bee passing pleasing for us to
heare.</p>

<p>Out of the Chamber went they, and descended downe the
stayres to the Court doore; where, without opening it, she laide her
mouth to a small cranny, and in a low soft kinde of voyce, called
him by his name: which the Scholler hearing, was exceeding joyful,
as beleeving verily, that the houre of his deliverance was come,
and entrance now should be admitted him. Upon the hearing of
her voyce, hee stept close to the doore, saying. For charities sake,
good Lady, let me come in, because I am almost dead with cold; whereto
thus she answered in mocking manner. I make no doubt (my deare
friend <i>Reniero</i>) but the night is indifferent colde, and yet somewhat
the warmer by the Snowes falling: and I have heard that such weather
as this, is tenne-times more extreame at <i>Paris</i>, then heere in our
warmer Countrey. And trust me, I am exceeding sorrowfull, that I
may not (as yet) open the door, because mine unhappy brother, who
came (unexpected) yester-night to suppe with mee, is not yet gone, as
within a short while (I hope) he will, and then shall I gladly set open
the doore to you, for I made an excuse to steale a little from him, onely
to cheare you with this small kind of comfort, that his so long tarrying
might be the lesse offensive to you.</p>

<p>Alas sweet Madame, answered quaking and quivering <i>Reniero</i>,
bee then so favourable to me, as to free me from forth this open Court,
where there is no shelter or helpe for me, the snow falling still so exceedingly,
as a man might easily be more then halfe buried in it: let me be
but within your doore, and there I will wait your own good leisure. Alas
deare <i>Reniero</i> (answered <i>Helena</i>) I dare not doe it, because the doore
maketh such a noyse in the opening, as it will be too easily heard by my
Brother: but I will goe and use such meanes, as shortly hee shall get
him gone, and then I dare boldly give you entrance. Doe so good
Madame, replyed <i>Reniero</i>, and let there be a faire fire made ready,
that when I am within, I may the sooner warme my selfe; for I am so
strangely benummed with colde, as well neere I am past all sence of feeling.</p>

<p>Can it be possible (quoth <i>Helena</i>) that you should be so benummed
with colde? Then I plainely perceive, that men can lye in their love
letters, which I can shew under your own hand, how you fryed in flames,
and all for my love, and so have you written to me in every letter.
Poore credulous women are often thus deluded, in beleeving what men
write and speake out of passion: but I will returne backe to my Brother,
and make no doubt of dispatch, because I would gladly have your
Company.</p>

<p>The amourous Friend to <i>Helena</i>, who stood by all this while,
laughing at the Schollers hard usage, returned up againe with her to
her Chamber, where they could not take a jote of rest, for flouting
and scorning the betrayed Scholler. As for him poore man, hee
was become like the Swanne, coldly chattering his teeth together,
in a strange new kinde of harmony to him. And perceiving himselfe
to be meerely mocked, he attempted to get open the doore, or
how he might passe forth at any other place: but being no way able
to compasse it, he walked up and downe like an angry Lyon,
cursing the hard quality of the time, the discourtesie of the Lady,
the over-tedious length of the night; but (most of all) his owne
folly and simplicity, in being so basely abused and gulde. Now began
the heat of his former affection to <i>Helena</i>, altered into as violent
a detestation of her; Yea, extremity of hatred in the highest
degree; beating his braines, and ransacking every corner of invention,
by what meanes he might best be revenged on her, which now
he more earnestly desired to effect, then to enjoy the benefit of her
love, or to be embraced betweene her armes.</p>

<p>After that the sad and discomfortable night had spent it selfe,
&amp; the break of day was beginning to appeare; <i>Ancilla</i> the waiting-woman,
according as she was instructed by her Lady, went downe
and opened the Court doore, and seeming exceedingly to compassionate
the Schollers unfortunate night of sufferance, saide unto
him.</p>

<p>Alas courteous Gentleman, in an unblessed houre came my Ladyes
brother hither yester-night, inflicting too much trouble upon us, and
a grievous time of affliction to you. But I am not ignorant, that you
being vertuous, and a judicious Scholler, have an invincible spirit of
pacience, and sufficient understanding withall; that what this night
could not affoord, another may make a sound amends for. This I can
and dare sufficiently assure you, that nothing could be more displeasing
to my Lady, neither can she well be quieted in her mind: untill she have
made a double and treble requitall, for such a strange unexpected inconvenience,
whereof she had not the very least suspition.</p>

<p><i>Reniero</i> swelling with discontentment, yet wisely clouding it
from open apprehension, and knowing well enough, that such golden
speeches and promises, did alwaies favour of what intemperate
spleene would more lavishly have vented foorth, and therefore in a
modest dissembling manner; without the least shew of any anger,
thus he answered.</p>

<p>In good sadnesse <i>Ancilla</i>, I have endured the most miserablest night
of colde, frost and snow, that ever any poore Gentleman suffered; but I
know well enough, your Lady was not in any fault thereof, neither meriteth
to be blamed, for in her owne person (as being truely compassionate
of my distresse) she came so farre as the doore of this Court, to excuse
her selfe, and comfort mee. But as you saide, and very well too,
what hath failed this night, another hereafter may more fortunately
performe: in hope whereof, commend my love and duteous service to
her, and (what else remaineth mine) to your gentle selfe.</p>

<p>So our halfe frozen Scholler, scarcely able to walke upon his
legges, returned home, (so well as hee could) to his owne lodging;
where, his Spirits being grievously out of order, and his eyes staring
gastly through lacke of sleepe: he lay downe on his bed, and after a
little rest, he found himselfe in much worse condition then before,
as meerely taken lame in his armes and his legges. Whereupon
he was inforced to send for Phisitions, to be advised by their councell,
in such an extremity of cold received. Immediately, they made
provision for his healthes remedie (albeit his nerves and sinewes
could very hardly extend themselves) yet in regard he was young, &amp;
Summer swiftly drawing on; they had the better hope of affecting
his safty, out of so great and dangerous a cold.</p>

<p>But after he was become almost well and lusty againe, hee used
to be seldome seene abroad for an indifferent while; concealing his
intended revenge secret to himselfe, yet appearing more affectionate
to Madame <i>Helena</i>, then formerly he had beene.</p>

<p>Now, it came to passe (within no long while after) that Fortune
being favourable to our injured Scholler, prepared a new accident,
whereby he might fully effect his harts desire. For the lusty young Gallant,
who was Madame <i>Helenaes</i> deare darling and delight, and (for
whose sake) she dealt so inhumanely with poore <i>Reniero</i>: became
weary of her amourous service, and was falne in liking of another
Lady, scorning and disdaining his former Mistresse; whereat shee
grew exceedingly displeased, and began to languish in sighes and
teares.</p>

<p>But <i>Ancilla</i> her waiting-woman, compassionating the perilous
condition of her Lady, and knowing no likely meanes whereby to
conquer this oppressing melancholly, which shee suffered for the
losse of her hearts chosen friend: at length she began to consider,
that the Scholler still walked daily by the doore, as formerly hee
was wont to doe, and (by him) there might some good be done.</p>

<p>A fond and foolish opinion overswayed her, that the Scholler
was extraordinarily skilfull in the Art of Nigromancy, and could
thereby so over-rule the heart of her lost friend, as hee should bee
compelled to love her againe, in as effectuall manner as before;
herewith immediately she acquainted her Lady, who being as rashly
credulous, as her maide was opinionative (never considring,
that if the Scholler had any experience in Negromancy, hee would
thereby have procured his owne successe) gave releefe to her surmise,
in very Joviall and comfortable manner, and entreated her
in all kindnes, to know of him, whether he could worke such a businesse,
or no, and (upon his undertaking to effect it) shee would give
absolute assurance, that (in recompence thereof) he should unfainedly
obtaine his hearts desire. <i>Ancilla</i> was quicke and expeditious,
in delivering this message to discontented <i>Reniero</i>, whose soule being
ready to mount out of his body, onely by conceit of joy; chearefully
thus he said within himselfe. Gracious Fortune! how highly am I
obliged to thee for this so great a favour? Now thou hast blest me with
a happy time, to be justly revenged on so wicked a woman, who sought
the utter ruine of my life, in recompence of the unfaigned affection I
bare her. Returne to thy Lady (quoth he) and saluting her first on
my behalfe, bid her to abandon all care in this businesse; for, if her amourous
Friend were in India, I would make him come (in meere despight
of his heart) and crave mercy of her for his base transgression.
But concerning the meanes how, and in what manner it is to bee done,
especially on her owne behalfe: I will impart it to her so soone as she
pleaseth: faile not to tell her so constantly from me, with all my utmost
paines at her service.</p>

<p><i>Ancilla</i> came jocondly home with her answere, and a conclusion
was set downe for their meeting together at <i>Santa Lucia del prato</i>,
which accordingly was performed, in very solemne conference between
them. Her fond affection had such power over her, that shee
had forgot, into what peril she brought his life, by such an unnatural
night-walke: but disclosed all her other intention to him, how loth
she was to lose so deare a friend, and desiring him to exercise his utmost
height of skil, with large promises of her manifold favours to
him, whereto our Scholler thus replyed.</p>

<p>Very true it is Madam, that among other studies at <i>Paris</i>, I learned
the Art of Negromancy, the depth whereof I am as skilful in, as anie
other Scholler whatsoever. But, because it is greatly displeasing unto
God, I made a vow never to use it, either for my selfe, or anie other.
Neverthelesse, the love I beare you is of such power, as I know not well
how to denie, whatsoever you please to command me: in which respect,
if in doing you my very best service, I were sure to bee seized on by all
the divels: I will not faile to accomplish your desire, you onely having
the power to command me. But let me tell you Madame, it is a matter
not so easie to be performed, as you perhaps may rashly imagine, especially,
when a Woman would repeale a man to love her, or a man a woman:
because, it is not to be done, but by the person whom it properly
concerneth. And therefore it behoveth, that such would have this
businesse effected, must be of a constant minde, without the least scruple
of feare: because it is to be accomplished in the darke night season, in
which difficulties I doe not know, how you are able to warrant your
selfe, or whether you have such courage of spirit, as (with boldnes)
to adventure.</p>

<p>Madame <i>Helena</i>, more hot in pursuite of her amorous contentment,
then any way governed by temperate discretion, presently
thus answered. Sir, Love hath set such a keene edge on my unconquerable
affection, as there is not any daunger so difficult, but I dare resolutely
undertake it, for the recovery of him, who hath so shamefully
refused my kindnesse: wherefore (if you please) shew mee, wherein I
must be so constant and dreadlesse. The Scholler, who had (more
then halfe) caught a right Ninny-hammer by the beake; thus replyed.
Madame, of necessity I must make an image of Tin, in the
name of him whom you desire to recall. Which when I have sent
you, the Moone being then in her full, and your selfe stript starke
naked: immediately after your first sleepe, seaven times you must
bathe your selfe with it in a swift running River. Afterward, naked
as you are, you must climbe up upon some tree, or else upon an uninhabited
house top, where standing dreadlesse of any perill, and
turning your face to the North, with the Image in your hand, seaven
times you must speake such wordes, as I will deliver to you in
writing.</p>

<p>After you have so often spoken them, two goodly Ladies (the
very fairest that ever you beheld) wil appeare unto you, very graciously
saluting you, and demanding what you would have them
to performe for you. Safely you may speake unto them, and orderly
tel them what you desire: but be very carefull, that you name
not one man insted of another. When you have uttered your mind,
they wil depart from you, and then you may descend againe, to the
place where you did leave your garments, which having putte on,
then returne to your house. And undoubtedly, before the midst
of the next night following, your friend wil come in teares to you,
and humbly crave your pardon on his knees; beeing never able afterward
to be false to you, or leave your Love for any other whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Lady hearing these words, gave very setled beleefe to them,
imagining unfainedly, that shee had (more then halfe) recovered
her friend already, and held him embraced betweene her armes: in
which jocond perswasion, the chearful blood mounted up into hir
cheekes, and thus she replyed. Never make you any doubt Sir, but
that I can sufficiently performe whatsoever you have said, and am
provided of the onely place in the world, where such a weighty businesse
is to be effected. For I have a Farme or dairy house, neere
adjoyning to the vale of <i>Arno</i>, &amp; closely bordering upon the same
River. It beeing now the moneth of July, the most convenientest
time of all the yeare to bathe in; I can bee the easier induced thereunto.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is hard by the Rivers side a small Tower or Turret
uninhabited; whereinto few people do sildome enter, but onely
Heardsmen or Flocke-keepers, who ascend uppe (by the helpe of a
wodden Ladder) to a Tarrasse on the top of the saide Tower, to
looke all about for their beasts, when they are wandred astray: it
standing in a solitary place, and out of the common way or resort.
There dare I boldly adventure to mount up, and with the invincible
courage of a wronged Lady (not fearing to looke death himself
in the face) do al that you have prescribed, yea, and much more, to
recover my deare lost Lover againe, whom I value equall with my
owne Life.</p>

<p><i>Reniero</i>, who perfectly knew both the Dairy Farme, and the old
small Turret, not a little joyful, to heare how forward shee was to
shame her selfe, answered in this manner. Madame, I was never in
those parts of the Country, albeit they are so neere to our City, &amp; therfore
I must needs be ignorant, not onely of your Farme, but the Turret
also. But if they stand in such convenient manner as you have described,
all the world could not yeelde the like elsewhere, so apt and sutable
to your purpose: wherefore, with such expedition as possibly I can
use, I will make the Image, and send it you, as also the charme, verie
fairely written. But let me entreate you, that when you have obtayned
your hearts desire, and are able to judge truely of my love and service:
not to be unmindfull of me, but (at your best leysure) to performe
what you have with such protestations promised; which shee gave him
her hand and faith to do, without any impeach or hindrance: and so
parting, she returned home to her house.</p>

<p>Our over-joyed Scholler, applauding his happy Starres, for furthering
him with so faire a way to his revenge; immagining that it
was already halfe executed, made the Image in due forme, &amp; wrote
an old Fable, in sted of a Charme; both which he sent to the Lady,
so soone as he thought the time to be fitting: and this admonition
withall, that the Moone being entering into the full, without
any longer delay, she might venter on the businesse the next night
following, and remaine assured to repossesse her friend. Afterward
for the better pleasing of himselfe, he went secretly attended, onely
by his servant, to the house of a trusty friend of his, who dwelt somwhat
neere to the Turret, there to expect the issue of this Lady-like
enterprize. And Madam <i>Helena</i> accompanied with none but <i>Ancilla</i>,
walked on to her dairy Farme, where the night ensuing, pretending
to take her rest sooner then formerly she used to doe, she commanded
<i>Ancilla</i> to go to bed, referring her selfe to her best liking.</p>

<p>After she had slept her first sleepe (according to the Schollers direction)
departing softly out of her chamber, she went on towards
the ancient Tower, standing hard by the river of <i>Arno</i>, looking every
way heedfully about hir, least she should be spied by any person.
But perceiving hir selfe to be so secure as she could desire; putting
off all her garments, she hid them in a small brake of bushes: afterward,
holding the Image in hir hand, seven times she bathd hir body
in the river, and then returned back with it to the Tower. The
Scholler, who at the nights closing up of day, had hid himselfe among
the willowes &amp; other trees, which grew very thick about the
Tower, saw both hir going and returning from the River, and as she
passed thus naked by him, he plainly perceyved, that the nights obscurity
could not cloud the delicate whitenes of hir body, but made
the Starres themselves to gaze amorously on her, even as if they
were proud to behold her bathing, and (like so many twinkling Tapers)
shewed hir in emulation of another <i>Diana</i>. Now, what conflicts
this sight caused in the mind of our Scholler, one while, quenching
his hatefull spleen towards hir, al coveting to imbrace a piece
of such perfection: another while, thinking it a purchase fit for one
of <i>Cupids</i> soldiers, to seize and surprize hir uppon so faire an advantage,
none being neere to yeild her rescue: in the fiery triall of such
temptations, I am not able to judge, or to say, what resistance flesh
and blood could make, being opposed with such a sweet enemy.</p>

<p>But he well considering what she was, the greatnes of his injury,
as also how, and for whom: he forgot all wanton allurements of
Love, scorning to entertaine a thought of compassion, continuing
constant in his resolution, to let her suffer, as he himselfe had done.
So, <i>Helena</i> being mounted up on the Turret, and turning her face
towards the North; she repeated those idle frivolous words (composed
in the nature of a charme) which shee had received from the
Scholler. Afterward, by soft and stealing steps, hee went into the
old Tower, and tooke away the Ladder, whereby she ascended to
the Tarras, staying and listening, how shee proceeded in her amorous
exorcisme.</p>

<p>Seven times she rehearsed the charme to the Image, looking still
when the two Ladies would appeare in their likenesse, and so long
she held on her imprecations (feeling greater cold, then willinglie
she would have done) that breake of day began to shew it selfe, and
halfe despairing of the Ladies comming, according as the Scholler
had promised, she said to her selfe: I much misdoubt, that <i>Reniero</i>
hath quitted me with such another peece of night-service, as it was
my lucke to bestow on him: but if he have done it in that respect, hee
was but ill advised in his revenge, because the night wants now three
parts of the length, as then it had: and the cold which he suffered, was
far superior in quality to mine, albeit it is more sharp now in the morning,
then all the time of night it hath bin.</p>

<p>And, because day-light should not discover her on the Tarrasse,
she went to make her descent downe againe: but finding the Ladder
to be taken away, &amp; thinking how her publike shame was now
inevitable, her heart dismayed, and shee fell downe in a swoune on
the Tarras: yet recovering her senses afterward, her greefe and sorow
exceeded all capacity of utterance. For, now she became fully
perswaded, that this proceeded from the Schollers malice, repenting
for her unkinde usage towards him, but much more condemning
her selfe, for reposing any trust in him, who stood bound
(by good reason) to be her enemy.</p>

<p>Continuing long in this extreame affliction, and surveighing all
likely meanes about her, whereby she might descend from the Tarras,
whereof she was wholly disappointed: she began to sighe and
weepe exceedingly, and in this heavy perplexity of spirit, thus shee
complained to her selfe. Miserable and unfortunate <i>Helena</i>, what
will be saide by thy Bretheren, Kindred, Neighbours, and generallie
throughout all <i>Florence</i>, when they shall know, that thou wast founde
heere on this Turret, starke naked? Thine honourable carriage, and
honesty of life, heeretofore free from a thought of suspition, shall now
be branded with detestation; and if thou wouldst cloud this mishappe
of thine, by such lies and excuses, as are not rare amongst women: yet
<i>Reniero</i> that wicked Scholler, who knoweth all thy privy compacting,
will stand as a thousand witnesses against thee, and shame thee before
the whole City, so both thine honour and loved friend are lost for ever.</p>

<p>Having thus consulted with her selfe, many desperate motions
entred her minde, to throw her selfe headlong from off the Tarras;
till better thoughts wone possession of her soule. And the Sunne
being risen, shee went to every corner of the Tarras, to espye any
Lad come abroad with his beasts, by whom she might send for her
waiting-woman. About this instant, the Scholler who lay sleeping
(all this while) under a bush, suddenly awaking; saw her looke over
the wall, and she likewise espyed him; whereupon hee said unto
her. Good morrow Madame <i>Helena</i>, What? are the Ladies come yet
or no? <i>Helena</i> hearing his scorning question, and grieving that hee
should so delude her; in teares and lamentations, she intreated him
to come neere the Tower, because she desired to speake with him.
Which courtesie he did not deny her, and she lying groveling upon
her brest on the Tarras, to hide her body that no part thereof
might be seene, but her head; weeping, she spake thus to him.</p>

<p><i>Reniero</i>, upon my credit, if I gave thee an ill nights rest, thou hast
well revenged that wrong on me; for, although wee are now in the
moneth of <i>July</i>, I have beene plagued with extremity of colde (in regard
of my nakednesse) even almost frozen to death: beside my continuall
teares and lamenting, that folly perswaded me to beleeve thy protestations,
wherein I account it well-neere miraculous, that mine eyes
should be capable of any sight. And therefore I pray thee, not in respect
of any love which thou canst pretend to beare me; but for regard of thine
owne selfe, being a Gentleman and a Scholler, that this punishment which
thou hast already inflicted upon me, may suffise for my former injuries
towards thee, and to hold thy selfe revenged fully, as also permit my garments
to be brought me, that I may descend from hence, without taking
that from me, which afterward (although thou wouldst) thou canst never
restore me, I meane mine honour. And consider with thy selfe, that
albeit thou didst not injoy my company that unhappy night, yet thou hast
power to command me at any time whensoever, with making many diversities
of amends, for one nights offence only committed. Content thy selfe
then good <i>Reniero</i>, and as thou art an honest Gentleman, say thou art
sufficiently revenged on me, in making me dearely confesse mine owne
error. Never exercise thy malice upon a poore weake woman, for the
Eagle disdaineth to pray on the yeelding Dove: and therefore in meere
pitty, and for manhoods sake, be my release from open shame and reproch.</p>

<p>The Scholler, whose envious spleene was swolne very great, in
remembring such a malicious cruelty exercised on him, beholding
her to weepe and make such lamentations; found a fierce conflict
in his thoughts, betweene content and pitty. It did not a little joy
and content him, that the revenge which hee so earnestly desired to
compasse, was now by him so effectually inflicted. And yet (in meere
humanity) pitty provoked him to commisserate the Ladies distressed
condition: but clemency being over-weake to withstand his
rigour, thus he replied. Madame <i>Helena</i>, if my entreaties (which, to
speake truly, I never knew how to steepe in tears, nor wrap up my words
in sugar Candie, so cuningly as you women know how to do) could have
prevailed, that miserable night, when I was well-neere frozen to death
with cold, and meerly buried with snow in your Court, not having anie
place of rescue or shelter; your complaints would now the more easily over-rule
me. But if your honour in estimation, bee now more precious to
you then heretofore, and it seemeth so offensive to stand there naked:
convert your perswasions &amp; prayers to him, in whose armes you were
that night imbraced, both of your triumphing in my misery, when poor
I, trotted about your Court, with the teeth quivering in my head, and
beating mine armes about my body, finding no compassion in him, or
you. Let him bring thee thy Garments, let him come helpe thee down
with the Ladder, and let him have the care of thine honour, on whom
thou hast bene so prodigall heretofore in bestowing it, and now hast unwomanly
throwne thy selfe in perill, onely for the maintenance of thine
immodest desires.</p>

<p>Why dost thou not call on him to come helpe thee? To whom doeth it
more belong, then to him? For thou art his, and he thine, why then shold
any other but he help thee in this distresse? Call him (foole as thou art)
and try, if the love he beareth thee, and thy best understanding joyned
with his, can deliver thee out of my sottish detaining thee. I have not
forgot, that when you both made a pastime of my misery, thou didst demand
of him, which seemed greatest in his opinion, either my sottish
simplicity, or the love thou barest him. I am not now so liberall or courteous,
to desire that of thee, which thou wouldst not grant, if I did request it:
No, no, reserve those night favours for thy amorous friend, if
thou dost escape hence alive to see him againe. As for my selfe, I leave
thee freely to his use and service: because I have sufficiently payde for a
womans falshood, &amp; wise men take such warning, that they scorne to bee
twice deceived, &amp; by one woman. Proceed on stil in thy flattering perswasions,
terming me to be a Gentleman and a Scholler, thereby to win
such favor from me, that I should think thy villany toward me, to be already
sufficiently punished. No, trecherous <i>Helena</i>, thy blandishments
cannot now hoodwink the eies of my understanding, as when thou didst
out-reach me with thy disloyall promises and protestations. And let
me now tell thee plainely, that all the while I continued in the Universitie
of <i>Paris</i>, I never attained unto so perfect an understanding
of my selfe, as in that one miserable night thou diddest enstruct mee.
But admit, that I were enclined unto a mercifull and compassionate
minde, yet thou art none of them, on whome milde and gracious
mercy should any way declare her effects. For, the end of pennance among
savage beasts, such as thou art, and likewise of due vengeance,
ought to be death: whereas among men, it should suffice according to
thine owne saying. Wherefore, in regard that I am neither an Eagle,
nor thou a Dove, but rather a most venomous Serpent: I purpose with
my utmost hatred, and as an ancient enemy to all such as thou art, to
make my revenge famous on thee.</p>

<p>I am not ignorant, that whatsoever I have already done unto thee,
cannot properly be termed revenge, but rather chastisement; because
revenge ought alwayes to exceede the offence, which (as yet) I am farre
enough from. For, if I did intend to revenge my wrongs, and remembred
thy monstrous cruelty to me: thy life, if I tooke it from thee, and
an hundred more such as thy selfe, were farre insufficient, because in
killing thee, I should kill but a vile inhumane beast, yea, one that deserved
not the name of a Woman. And, to speake truely, Art thou any
more, or better (setting aside thy borrowed haire, and painted beauty,
which in few yeares will leave thee wrinkled and deformed) then the
basest beggarly Chamber-stuffe that can bee? Yet thou soughtest the
death of a Gentleman and Scholler as (in scorne) not long since, thou
didst terme me: whose life may hereafter be more beneficiall unto the
world, then millions of such as thou art, to live in the like multiplicity
of ages. Therefore, if this anguish be sensible to thee, learne what it is
to mocke men of apprehension, and (amongst them especially) such as
are Schollers: to prevent thy falling hereafter into the like extremity,
if it be thy good lucke to escape out of this.</p>

<p>It appeareth to me, that thou art verie desirous to come downe hither
on the ground; the best counsell that I can give thee, is to leape
downe headlong, that by breaking thy necke (if thy fortune be so faire)
thy life and lothsome qualities ending together, I may sit and smile at
thy deserved destruction. I have no other comfort to give thee, but only
to boast my happinesse, in teaching thee the way to ascend that Tower,
and in thy descending downe (even by what means thy wit can best
devise) make a mockery of me, and say thou hast learned more, then all
my Schollership could instruct thee.</p>

<p>All the while as <i>Reniero</i> uttered these speeches, the miserable Lady
sighed and wept very grievously, the time running on, and the
Sunne amending higher and higher; but when she heard him silent,
thus she answered. Unkinde and cruell man, if that wretched night
was so greevous to thee, and mine offence appeared so great, as neither
my youth, beautie, teares, and humble intercessions, are able to derive
any mercy from thee; yet let the last consideration moove thee to
some remorse: namely, that I reposed new confidence in thee (when I had
little or no reason at all to trust thee) and discovered the integritie of
my soule unto thee, whereby thou didst compasse the meanes, to punish
me thus deservedly for my sinne. For, if I had not reposed confidence
in thee, thou couldst not (in this manner) have wrought revenge on me,
which although thou didst earnestly covet, yet my rash credulitie was
thy onely helpe. Asswage then thine anger, and graciously pardon me,
wherein if thou wilt be so mercifull to me, and free me from this fatall
Tower: I do heere faithfully promise thee, to forsake my most false
and disloyall friend, electing thee as my Lord and constant Love for
ever.</p>

<p>Moreover, although thou condemnest my beauty greatly, esteeming it
as a trifle, momentary, and of slender continuance; yet, such as it is (being
comparable with any other womans whatsoever) I am not so ignorant,
that were there no other reason to induce liking thereof: yet men in the
vigour of their youth (as I am sure you think yourselfe not aged) do hold
it for an especiall delight, ordained by nature for them to admire and honour.
And notwithstanding all thy cruelty extended to mee, yet I cannot
be perswaded, that thou art so flinty or Iron-hearted, as to desire my miserable
death, by casting my selfe headlong downe (like a desperate madde
woman) before thy face so to destroy that beauty, which (if thy Letters lyed
not) was once so highly pleasing in thine eyes. Take pitty then on mee
for charities sake, because the Sunne beginneth to heate extreamely: and
as over-much colde (that unhappy night) was mine offence, so let not over-violent
warmth be now my utter ruine and death.</p>

<p>The Scholler, who (onely to delight himselfe) maintained this
long discoursing with her, returned her this answere. Madame, you
did not repose such confidence in me, for any good will or affection in you
towards me, but in hope of recovering him whom you had lost; wherein
you merit not a jot of favour, but rather the more sharpe and severe infliction.
And whereas you inferre, that your over-rash credulity, gave
the onely meanes to my revenge: Alas! therein you deceive your selfe;
for I have a thousand crochets working continually in my brain, whereby
to entrap a wiser creature then a woman, yet veiled all under the
cunning cloake of love, but sauced with the bitter Wormewood of hate.
So that, had not this hapned as now it doth, of necessity you must have
falne into another: but, as it hath pleased my happy stars to favour mee
therein, none could proove more to your eternall scandall and disgrace,
then this of your owne devising, which I made choise of, not in regard
of any ease to you, but onely to content my selfe.</p>

<p>But if all other devises els had failed, my pen was and is my prevayling
Champion, where-with I would have written such and so many
strange matters, concerning you in your very dearest reputation; that
you should have curst the houre of your conception, &amp; wisht your birth
had bin abortive. The powers of the pen are too many &amp; mighty, whereof
such weake wits as have made no experience, are the lesse able to use
any relation. I sweare to you Lady, by my best hopes, that this revenge
which (perhappes) you esteeme great and dishonourable, is no way
compareable to the wounding Lines of a Penne, which can charracter
downe so infinite infamies (yet none but guilty and true taxations) as
will make your owne hands immediate instruments, to teare the eyes
from forth your head, and so bequeath your after dayes unto perpetuall
darkenesse.</p>

<p>Now, concerning your lost lover, for whose sake you suffer this unexpected
pennance; although your choise hath proved but bad, yet still
continue your affection to him: in regard that I have another Ladie
and Mistresse, of higher and greater desert then you, and to whome I
will continue for ever constant. And whereas you thinke, the warme
beames of the Sunne, will be too hot and scorching for your nice bodie
to endure: remember the extreame cold which you caused mee to feele,
and if you can intermixe some part of that cold with the present heat,
I dare assure you, the Sun (in his highest heate) will be far more temperate
for your feeling.</p>

<p>The disconsolate Lady perceiving, that the Schollers wordes favoured
of no mercy, but rather as coveting her desperate ending;
with the teares streaming downe her cheekes, thus she replied. Wel
Sir, seeing there is no matter of worth in me, whereby to derive any
compassion from you: yet for that Ladies sake, whom you have
elected worthy to enjoy your love, and so farre excelleth mee in
Wisedome; vouchsafe to pardon mee, and suffer my garments to
be brought me, wherewith to cover my nakednesse, and so to descend
downe from this Tower, if it may stand with your gentle Nature
to admit it.</p>

<p>Now beganne <i>Reniero</i> to laughe very heartily, and perceiving
how swiftly the day ran on in his course, he saide unto her. Beleeve
me Madame <i>Helena</i>, you have so conjured me by mine endeered Ladie
and Mistresse, that I am no longer able to deny you; wherefore, tell me
where your garments are, and I will bring them to you, that you may
come downe from the Turret. She beleeving his promise, tolde him
where she had hid them, and <i>Reniero</i> departing from the Tower,
commanded his servant, not to stirre thence: but to abide still so
neere it, as none might get entrance there till his returning. Which
charge was no sooner given to his man, but hee went to the house
of a neere neighbouring friend, where he dined well, and afterward
laid him downe to sleepe.</p>

<p>In the meane while, Madame <i>Helena</i> remaining still on the Tower,
began to comfort her selfe with a little vaine hope, yet sighing
and weeping incessantly, seating her selfe so well as shee could,
where any small shelter might yeelde the least shade, in expectation
of the Schollers returning: one while weeping, then againe hoping,
but most of all despairing, by his so long tarrying away with
her Garments; so that beeing over-wearied with anguish and long
watching, she fell into a little slumbering. But the Sunne was so
extreamly hot, the houre of noone being already past, that it meerly
parched her delicate body, and burnt her bare head so violently:
as not onely it seared all the flesh it touched; but also cleft &amp; chinkt
it strangely, beside blisters and other painfull scorchings in the flesh
which hindred her sleeping, to help her self (by all possible means)
waking. And the Turret being covered with Lead, gave the greater
addition to her torment; for, as she removed from one place to
another, it yeelded no mitigation to the burning heate, but parched
and wrinkled the flesh extraordinarily, even as when a piece of
parchment is throwne into the fire, and recovered out againe, can
never be extended to his former forme.</p>

<p>Moreover, she was so grievously payned with the head-ake, as it
seemed to split in a thousand pieces, whereat there needed no great
marvaile, the Lead of the Turret being so exceedingly hot, that it
affoorded not the least defence against it, or any repose to qualifie
the torment: but drove her still from one place to another, in hope
of ease, but none was there to be found.</p>

<p>Nor was there any winde at all stirring, whereby to asswage the
Sunnes violent scalding, or keepe away huge swarmes of Waspes,
Hornets, and terrible byting Flyes, which vexed her extreamely,
feeding on those parts of her body, that were rifte and chinkt, like
crannies in a mortered wall, and pained her like so many points of
pricking Needles, labouring still with her hands to beate them away,
but yet they fastned on one place or other, and afflicted her
in grievous manner, causing her to curse her owne life, hir amorous
friend, but (most of all) the Scholler, that promised to bring her
Garments, and as yet returned not. Now began she to gaze upon
every side about her, to espy some labouring Husbandmen in the
fields, to whom she might call or cry out for helpe, not fearing to
discover her desperate condition: but Fortune therein also was adverse
to her, because the heats extreamity, had driven all the village
out of the fields, causing them to feede their Cattle about theyr
owne houses, or in remote and shadie Valleyes: so that shee could
see no other creatures to comfort her, but Swannes swimming in
the River of <i>Arno</i>, and wishing her selfe there a thousand times with
them, for to coole the extreamity of her thirst, which so much the
more encreased, onely by the sight thereof, and utterly disabled of
having any.</p>

<p>She saw beside in many places about her, goodly Woods, fayre
coole shades, and Country houses here and there dispersed; which
added the greater violence to hir affliction, that her desires (in all
these) could no way be accomplished. What shall I say more concerning
this disastrous Lady? The parching beames of the Sunne
above her, the scalding heat of the Lead beneath her, the Hornets
and Flyes everie way stinging her, had made such an alteration of
her beautifull bodie: that, as it checkt and controlled the precedent
nights darkenesse, it was now so metamorphosed with rednesse,
yea, and blood issuing forth in infinite places, as she seemed
(almost) loathsome to looke on, continuing still in this agonie of
torment, quite voyde of all hope, and rather expecting death, then
any other comfort.</p>

<p><i>Reniero</i>, when some three houres of the afternoone were overpast,
awaked from sleeping: and remembring Madame <i>Helena</i>, he
went to see in what estate she was; as also to send his servant unto
dinner, because he had fasted all that day. She perceyving his arrivall,
being altogether weake, faint, and wonderously over-wearied,
she crept on her knees to a corner of the Turret, and calling to
him, spake in this manner. <i>Reniero</i>, thy revenge exceedeth al manhoode
and respect: For, if thou wast almost frozen in my Court,
thou hast roasted me all day long on this Tower, yea, meerly broyled
my poore naked bodie, beside starving mee thorough want of
Food and drinke. Be now then so mercifull (for manhoods sake)
as to come uppe hither, and inflict that on me, which mine owne
hands are not strong enough to do, I meane the ending of my loathed
and wearisome life, for I desire it beyond all comfort else, and
I shall honour thee in the performance of it. If thou deny me this
gracious favour; at least send me uppe a glasse of Water, onely
to moisten my mouth, which my teares (being all meerly dried up)
are not able to doe, so extreame is the violence of the Sunnes burning
heate.</p>

<p>Well perceived the Scholler, by the weaknesse of her voyce, and
scorching of her body by the Suns parching beames, that shee was
brought now to great extremity: which sight, as also her humble intercession,
began to touch him with some compassion, nevertheles,
thus he replied. Wicked woman, my hands shal be no means of thy
death, but make use of thine owne, if thou be so desirous to have it:
and as much water shalt thou get of me to asswage thy thirst, as thou
gavest me fire to comfort my freezing, when thou wast in the luxurious
heat of thy immodest desires, and I wel-neere frozen to death
with extremity of cold. Pray that the Evening may raine downe
Rose-water on thee, because that in the River of <i>Arno</i> is not good
enough for thee: for as little pitty doe I take on thee now, as thou
didst extend compassion to me then.</p>

<p>Miserable Woman that I am, answered <i>Helena</i>; Why did the heavens
bestow beautie on mee, which others have admired and honoured,
and yet (by thee) is utterly despised? More cruell art thou then
any savage Beast; thus to vexe and torment mee in such mercilesse
manner. What greater extreamity couldst thou inflict on me, if I had
bin the destruction of all thy Kindred, and lefte no one man living of
thy race? I am verily perswaded, that more cruelty cannot be used against
a Traitor, who was the subversion of a whole Cittie, then this
tyranny of thine, roasting me thus in the beames of the Sun, and suffering
my body to be devoured with Flies, without so small a mercie; as
to give mee a little coole water, which murtherers are permitted to
have, being condemned by Justice, and led to execution: yea Wine also,
if they request it.</p>

<p>But, seeing thou art so constant in thy pernitious resolve, as neither
thine owne good Nature, nor this lamentable sufferance in me, are able
to alter thee: I will prepare my self for death patiently, to the end, that
Heaven may be mercifull to my soul, and reward thee justly, according
to thy cruelty. Which words being ended, she withdrew her selfe
towards the middest of the Tarras, despairing of escaping (with
life) from the heates violence; and not once onely, but infinite
times beside (among her other grievous extreamities) she was ready
to dye with drought, bemoaning incessantly her dolorous condition.</p>

<p>By this time the day was well neere spent, and night beganne to
hasten on apace: when the Scholler (immagining that he afflicted
her sufficiently) tooke her Garments, and wrapping them up in his
mans Cloake, went thence to the Ladies house, where he found
<i>Ancilla</i> the Waiting-woman sitting at the doore, sad and disconsolate
for her Ladies long absence, to whom thus he spake. How
now <i>Ancilla</i>? Where is thy Lady and Mistris? Alas Sir (quoth
she) I know not. I thought this morning to have found her in her
bed, as usually I was wont to do, and where I left her yesternight
at our parting: but there she was not, nor in any place else of my
knowledge, neyther can I imagine what is become of her, which is
to me no meane discomfort.</p>

<p>But can you (Sir) say any thing of her? <i>Ancilla</i>, said he, I would
thou hadst bin in her company, and at the same place where now
she is, that some punishment for thy fault might have falne uppon
thee, as already it hath done on her. But beleeve it assuredly, that
thou shalt not freely escape from my fingers, till I have justly paide
thee for thy paines, to teach thee to abuse any Gentleman, as thou
didst me.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, hee called to his servant, saying. Give her
the Garments, and bid her go looke her Lady, if she will. The Servingman
fulfilled his Masters command, and <i>Ancilla</i> having receyved
her Ladies cloaths, knowing them perfectly, and remembring
(withall) what had bin said: she waxed very doubtfull, least they
had slaine her, hardly refraining from exclaiming on them, but that
greefe and heavie weeping overcame her; so that uppon the Schollers
departing, she ranne in all hast with the garments towardes the
Tower.</p>

<p>Upon this fatall and unfortunate day to Madame <i>Helena</i>, it chanced,
that a Clowne or Countrey Peazant belonging to her Farme
or Dairy house, having two of his young Heyfers wandred astray,
and he labouring in diligent search to finde them: within a while
after the Schollers departure, came to seeke them in Woods about
the Tower, and, notwithstanding all his crying and calling for his
beasts, yet he heard the Ladies greevous moanes and lamentations.
Wherefore, he cryed out so lowd as he could, saying: Who is it
that mourneth so aloft on the Tower? Full well she knew the voyce
of her peazant, and therefore called unto him, and sayd in this manner.</p>

<p>Go (quoth she) I pray thee for my Waiting-woman <i>Ancilla</i>, and
bid her make some meanes to come up hither to me. The Clowne
knowing his Lady, sayde. How now Madame? Who hath carried
you up there so high? Your Woman <i>Ancilla</i> hath sought for
you all this day, yet no one could ever have immagined you to bee
there. So looking about him, he espyed the two sides of the Ladder,
which the Scholler had pulled in sunder; as also the steppes,
which he had scattered thereabout; placing them in due order againe
as they should bee, and binding them fast with Withies and
Willowes.</p>

<p>By this time <i>Ancilla</i> was come thither, who so soone as shee was
entred into the Tower, could not refrain from teares &amp; complaints,
beating her hands each against other, and crying out. Madam, Madam,
my deare Lady and Mistresse! Alas, Where are you? So
soone as she heard the tongue of <i>Ancilla</i>, she replyed (so well as she
could) saying: Ah my sweet Woman, I am heere aloft uppon the
Tarras; weepe not, neyther make any noyse, but quickely bring me
some of my Garments. When shee heard her answer in such comfortable
manner, she mounted up the Ladder, which the peazant had
made very firme and strong, holding it fast for her safer ascending;
by which meanes she went upon the Tarras. Beholding her Ladie
in so strange a condition, resembling no humane body, but rather
the trunke of a Tree halfe burned, lying flat on her face, naked, scorched
and strangely deformed: shee beganne to teare the lockes of
her owne hayre, raving and raging in as pittifull manner, as if her
Ladie had beene quite dead. Which storming tempest, Madame
<i>Helena</i> soone pacified, entreating her to use silence, and helpe to put
on her garments.</p>

<p>Having understood by her, that no one knew of her being there,
but such as brought her cloathes, and the poore peazant, attending
there still to do her any service: shee became the better comforted,
entreating them by all meanes, that it might bee concealed from any
further discovery, which was on eyther side, most faithfullie
protested.</p>

<p>The poore Clowne holpe to beare downe his Lady uppon his
backe, because the Ladder stood not conveniently enough for her
descending, neither were her limbes plyable for her owne use, by
reason of their rifts and smarting. <i>Ancilla</i> following after, and being
more respective of her Lady, then her owne security in descending;
missing the step in the midst of the Ladder, fell downe to the
ground, and quite brake her legge in the fall, the paine whereof was
so greevous to her, that she cried and roared extraordinarily, even
like a Lyon in the desert.</p>

<p>When the Clowne had set his Lady safe on a faire green banke,
he returned to see what the waiting woman ayled, and finding her
leg to be quite broken: he caried her also to the same banke, &amp; there
seated her by her Lady: who perceiving what a mischance had hapned,
and she, from whom she expected her onely best helpe, to bee
now in far greater necessity her selfe: shee lamented exceedingly,
complaining on Fortunes cruel malice toward her, in thus heaping
one misery upon another, and never ceasing to torment her, especially
now in the conclusion of all, and when shee thought all future
perils to be past.</p>

<p>Now was the Sun upon his setting, when the poore honest country-man,
because darke night should not overtake them, conducted
the Lady home to his owne house: and gaining the assistance of his
two brethren and wife, setting the waiting-woman in a Chaire, thither
they brought her in like manner. And questionles, there wanted
no diligence and comfortable language, to pacifie the Ladyes
continuall lamentations. The good wife, led the Lady into hir own
poore lodging, where (such cates as they had to feede on) lovingly
she set before her: conveying her afterward into her owne bed, and
taking such good order, that <i>Ancilla</i> was carried in the night time
to <i>Florence</i>, to prevent all further ensuing danger, by reason of her
legs breaking.</p>

<p>Madame <i>Helena</i>, to colour this misfortune of her owne: as also
the great mishap of her woman: forged an artificiall and cunning
tale, to give some formall apparance of hir being in the Tower, perswading
the poore simple Country people, that in a straunge accident
of thunder and lightning, and by the illusions of wicked spirits,
all this adventure hapned to her. Then Physitians were sent
for; who, not without much anguish and affliction to the Ladie (by
reason of her fleshes flaying off, with the Medicines and Emplaysters
applyed to the body) was glad to suffer whatsoever they did,
beside falling into a very dangerous Feaver; out of which she was
not recovered in a long while after, but continued in daily dispayre
of her life; beside other accidents hapning in her time of Physicke,
utterly unavoydable in such extreamities: and hardly had <i>Ancilla</i>
her legge cured.</p>

<p>By this unexpected pennance imposed on Madame <i>Helena</i>, she
utterly forgot her amorous friend, and (from thence forward) carefully
kept her selfe from fond loves allurements, and such scornfull
behaviour, wherein she was most disorderly faulty. And <i>Reniero</i>
the Scholler, understanding that <i>Ancilla</i> had broken her leg, which
he reputed as a punishment sufficient for her, held himselfe satisfyed,
because neither the Mistresse nor her Maide, could now make any
great boast, of his nights hard entertainment, and so concealed
all matters else.</p>

<p>Thus a wanton-headed Lady, could finde no other subject to
worke her mocking folly on, but a learned Scholler, of whom shee
made no more respect, then any other ordinary man. Never remembring,
that such men are expert (I cannot say all, but the greater
part of them) to helpe the frenzie of foolish Ladies, that must injoy
their loose desires, by Negromancy, and the Divelles meanes.
Let it therefore (faire Ladies) be my loving admonition to you, to
detest all unwomanly mocking and scorning, but more especiallie
to Schollers.</p>

<h4><a name="Two_neere_dwelling_Neighbours_the_one_beeing_named_Spinelloccio" id="Two_neere_dwelling_Neighbours_the_one_beeing_named_Spinelloccio"><i>Two neere dwelling Neighbours, the one beeing named</i> Spinelloccio
Tavena, <i>and the other</i> Zeppa di Mino, <i>frequenting each others
company daily together;</i> Spinelloccio <i>Cuckolded his Friend and
Neighbour. Which happening to the knowledge of</i> Zeppa, <i>he prevailed
so well with the Wife of</i> Spinelloccio, <i>that he being lockt up
in a Chest, he revenged his wrong at that instant, so that neither of
them complained of his misfortune.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Eight Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is approved, that he which offereth shame and disgrace to his
Neighbour; may receive the like injury (if not in worse manner) by
the same man.</i></h4>


<p>Greevous, and full of compassion, appeared the hard Fortunes
of Madame <i>Helena</i> to be, having much discontented,
and (well-neere) wearied all the Ladies in hearing
them recounted. But because they were very justly inflicted upon
her, and according as (in equity) shee had deserved, they were the
more moderate in their commisseration: howbeit, they reputed the
Scholler not onely over-obstinate, but also too strict, rigorous and
severe. Wherefore, when Madame <i>Pampinea</i> had finished hir Novell,
the Queene gave command to Madame <i>Fiammetta</i>, that she
should follow next with her discourse; whereto shee shewing obedience,
thus beganne.</p>

<p>Because it appeareth in my judgement (faire Ladyes) that the
Schollers cruelty hath much displeased you, making you more melancholly
then this time requireth: I holde it therefore very convenient,
that your contristed spirits should be chearfully revived, with
matter more pleasing and delightfull. And therefore, I mean to report
a Novell of a certaine man, who tooke an injury done him, in
much milder manner, and revenged his wrong more moderately,
then the furious incensed Scholler did. Whereby you may comprehend,
that it is sufficient for any man, and so he ought to esteeme
it, to serve another with the same sawce, which the offending party
caused him first to taste of: without coveting any stricter revenge,
then agreeth with the quality of the injury received.</p>

<p>Know then (Gracious assembly) that, as I have heretofore heard,
there lived not long since in <i>Sienna</i>, two young men, of honest parentage
and equall condition, neither of the best, nor yet the meanest
calling in the City: the one being named <i>Spinelloccio Tavena</i>,
and the other tearmed <i>Zeppa di Mino</i>, their houses Neighbouring
together in the streete <i>Camollia</i>. Seldome the one walked abroade
without the others Company, and their houses allowed equall welcome
to them both; so that by outward demonstrations, &amp; inward
mutuall affection, as far as humane capacity had power to extend,
they lived and loved like two Brethren, they both beeing wealthy,
and married unto two beautifull women.</p>

<p>It came to passe, that <i>Spinelloccio</i>, by often resorting to the house
of <i>Zeppa</i>, as well in his absence, as when he abode at home; beganne
to glance amorous looks on <i>Zeppaes</i> wife, and pursued his unneighbourly
purpose in such sort: that hee being the stronger perswader,
and she (belike) too credulous in beleeving, or else over-feeble in
resisting; from private imparlance, they fell to action; and continued
their close fight a long while together, unseene and without
suspition, no doubt to their equall joy and contentment.</p>

<p>But, whether as a just punishment, for breaking so loving a league
of friendship and neighbour-hood, or rather a fatall infliction, evermore
attending on the closest Cuckoldry, their felicity still continuing
in this kinde: it fortuned on a day, <i>Zeppa</i> abiding within doors,
contrary to the knowledge of his wife, <i>Spinelloccio</i> came to enquire
for him, and she answering (as she verily supposed) that he was gone
abroad: uppe they went both together into the Hall, and nobodie
being there to hinder what they intended, they fell to their wonted
recreation without any feare, kissing and embracing as Lovers use
to do.</p>

<p><i>Zeppa</i> seeing all this, spake not one word, neither made any noise
at all; but kept himselfe closely hidden, to observe the yssue of this
amorous conflict. To be briefe, he saw <i>Spinelloccio</i> goe with his
wife into the Chamber, and make the doore fast after them, whereat
he could have beene angry, which he held to be no part of true
wisedome. For he knew well enough, that to make an out crie in
this case, or otherwise to reveale this kinde of injury, it could no
way make it lesse, but rather give a greater addition of shame and
scandall: he thought this no course for him to take; wiser considerations
entred his braine, to have this wrong fully revenged, yet
with such a discreete and orderly carriage, as no neighbours knowledge
should by any meanes apprehend it, or the least signe of discontent
in himselfe blabbe it, because they were two daungerous
evils.</p>

<p>Many notable courses wheeled about his conceit, every one promising
fairely, and ministring meanes of formall apparance, yet one
(above the rest) wonne his absolute allowance, which he intended
to prosecute as best he might. In which resolution, he kept still very
close, so long as <i>Spinelloccio</i> was with his Wife; but hee being
gone, he went into the Chamber, where he found his wife, amending
the forme of her head attyre, which <i>Spinelloccio</i> had put into
a disordred fashion. Wife (quoth he) what art thou doing? Why?
Do you not see Husband? answered she. Yes that I do wife, replied
<i>Zeppa</i>, and something else happened to my sight, which I could
wish that I had not seene. Rougher Language growing betweene
them, of his avouching, and her as stout denying, with defending
her cause over-weakely, against the manifest proofes both of eye
and eare; at last she fell on her knees before him, weeping incessantly,
and no excuses now availing, she confest her long acquaintance
with <i>Spinelloccio</i>, and most humbly entreated him to forgive
her. Uppon the which penitent confession and submission, <i>Zeppa</i>
thus answered.</p>

<p>Wife, if inward contrition be answerable to thy outward seeming
sorrow, then I make no doubt, but faithfully thou dost acknowledge
thine owne evill dooing: for which, if thou expectest pardon
of me; determine then to fulfill effectually, such a busines as I must
enjoyne, and thou performe. I command thee to tell <i>Spinelloccio</i>,
that to morrow morning, about nine of the clocke, we being both
abroad walking, he must finde some apt occasion to leave my company,
and then come hither to visit thee. When he is here, sodainly
will I returne home; and upon thy hearing of my entraunce: to
save his owne credite, and thee from detection, thou shalt require
him to enter this Chest, untill such time as I am gone forth againe;
which he doing, for both your safeties, so soon as he is in the chest,
take the key and locke him up fast. When thou hast effected this,
then shall I acquaint thee with the rest remaining, which also must
be done by thee, without dread of the least harme to him or thee,
because there is no malicious meaning in me, but such as (I am perswaded)
thou canst not justly mislike. The wife, to make some satisfaction
for her offence committed, promised that she would performe
it, and so she did.</p>

<p>On the morrow morning, the houre of nine being come, when
<i>Zeppa</i> and <i>Spinelloccio</i> were walking abroad together, <i>Spinelloccio</i>
remembring his promise unto his Mistresse, and the clocke telling
him the appointed houre, hee saide to <i>Zeppa</i>. I am to dine this day
with an especiall friend of mine, who I would be loath should tarry
for my comming; and therefore holde my departure excused.
How now? answered <i>Zeppa</i>, the time for dinner is yet farre enough
off, wherefore then should we part so soone? Yea but <i>Zeppa</i>, replied
<i>Spinelloccio</i>, wee have weighty matters to confer on before dinner,
which will require three houres space at the least, and therefore
it behoveth me to respect due time.</p>

<p><i>Spinelloccio</i> being departed from Zeppa (who followed faire and
softly after him) being come to the house, and kindly welcommed
by the wife: they were no sooner gone up the staires, and entering
in at the Chamber doore; but the Woman heard her Husband
cough, and also his comming up the staires. Alas deare <i>Spinelloccio</i>
(quoth she) what shall we do? My Husband is comming uppe,
and we shall be both taken tardie, step into this Chest, lye downe
there and stirre not, till I have sent him forth againe, which shall be
within a very short while. <i>Spinelloccio</i> was not a little joyfull for
her good advice; downe in the Chest lay he, and she lockt him in:
by which time <i>Zeppa</i> was entred the Chamber. Where are you
Wife? said he, (speaking so loud, as hee in the Chest might heare
him) What, is it time to go to dinner? It will be anon Sir, answered
she, as yet it is overearly; but seeing you are come, the more hast
shall be made, and every thing will be ready quickly.</p>

<p><i>Zeppa</i>, sitting downe upon the Chest, wherein <i>Spinelloccio</i> lay
not a little affrighted, speaking stil aloud, as formerly he did: Come
hither Wife (quoth he) how shall we do for some good companie
to dine with us? Mine honest kinde neighbour <i>Spinelloccio</i> is not at
home, because he dineth forth to day with a deare friend of his, by
which meanes, his wife is left at home alone: give her a call out at
our Window, and desire her to come dine with us: for we two can
make no merry Musicke, except some more come to fill up the consort.</p>

<p>His Wife being very timorous, yet diligent to doe whatsoever
he commanded, so prevailed with the Wife of <i>Spinelloccio</i>: that
she came to them quickely, and so much the rather, because her
Husband dined abroad. Shee being come up into the Chamber,
<i>Zeppa</i> gave her most kinde entertainment, taking her gently by the
hand, and winking on his Wife, that she should betake her selfe to
the kitchin, to see dinner speedily prepared, while he sat conversing
with his neighbour in the Chamber.</p>

<p>His wife being gone, he shut the doore after her, which the new-come
Neighbour perceyving, she sayde. Our blessed Lady defend
me. <i>Zeppa</i>, What is your meaning in this? Have you caused me to
come hither to this intent? Is this the love you beare to <i>Spinelloccio</i>,
and your professed loyalty in friendshippe? <i>Zeppa</i>, seating her
downe on the Chest, wherein her Husband was inclosed, entreating
her patience, thus began. Kinde and loving Neighbor, before
you adventure too farre in anger, vouchsafe to heare what I shall
tell you.</p>

<p>I have loved, and still doe love, <i>Spinelloccio</i> as my brother, but
yesterday (albeit he knoweth it not) I found, the honest trust I reposed
in him, deserved no other, or better recompence, but even to
be bold with my wife, in the selfesame manner as I am, and as hee
ought to do with none but you. Now, in regard of the love which
I beare him, I intend to be no otherwise revenged on him, but in the
same kinde as the offence was committed. He hath bin more then
familiar with my wife, I must borrow the selfe-same courtesie of
you, which in equity you cannot deny mee, weighing the wrong
you have sustained by my wife. Our injuries are alike, in your Husband
to me, and in my wife to you: let then their punishment and
ours be alike also, as they, so we; for in this case there can be no juster
revenge.</p>

<p>The Woman hearing this, and perceiving the manifolde confirmations
thereof, protested (on solemne oath) by <i>Zeppa</i>; hir beliefe
grew setled, and thus she answered. My loving neighbour <i>Zeppa</i>, seeing
this kinde of revenge is (in meere justice) imposed on mee, and
ordained as a due scourge, as well to the breach of friendship and
neighbour-hood, as abuse of his true and loyall wife: I am the more
willing to consent: alwaies provided, that it be no imbarrement of
love betweene your wife and mee, albeit I have good reason to alledge,
that she began the quarrell first: and what I do is but to right
my wrong, as any other woman of spirit would do: Afterwards,
we may the more easily pardon one another. For breach of peace
(answered <i>Zeppa</i>) between my wife and you, take my honest word
for your warrant. Moreover, in requitall of this favour to mee, I
will bestowe a deare and precious Jewell on you, excelling all the
rest which you have beside.</p>

<p>In delivering these words, he sweetly kissed and embraced her, as
she sat on the Chest wherein her husband lay: now, what they did
else beside, in recompence of the wrong received, I leave to your
imagination, as rather deserving silence, then immodest blabbing.
<i>Spinelloccio</i>, being all this while in the Chest, hearing easily all the
words which <i>Zeppa</i> had uttered, the answer of his wife, as also what
Musicke they made over his head: you may guesse in what a case
he was, his heart being ready to split with rage, and, but that hee
stood in feare of <i>Zeppa</i>, he would have railde and exclaimed on his
wife, as thus hee lay shut up in the Chest. But entering into better
consideration, that so great an injury was first begun by himselfe, &amp;
<i>Zeppa</i> did no more, then in reason and equity he might well do (having
evermore carried himselfe like a kinde neighbour and friend towards
him, without the least offer of distaste) he faithfully resolved,
to be a firmer friend to <i>Zeppa</i> then formerly hee had bin, if it might
be embraced and accepted on the other side.</p>

<p>Delights and pleasures, be they never so long in contenting and
continuance, yet they come to a period and conclusion at last: So
<i>Zeppa</i>, having ended his amorous combate, and over the head of his
perfidious friend, thought himselfe sufficiently revenged. But now,
in consideration of a further promise made on the bargaine; <i>Spinelloccioes</i>
wife challengeth the Jewel, then which kind of recompence,
nothing can be more welcome to women. Heereupon, <i>Zeppa</i> calling
for his owne wife, commanded her to open the Chest; which shee
did, and he merrily smiling, saide. Well wife, you have given mee a
Cake insted of bread, and you shal lose nothing for your labour. So
<i>Spinelloccio</i> comming forth of the Chest, it requireth a better witte
then mine, to tell you, which of them stood most confounded with
shame, either <i>Spinelloccio</i> seeing <i>Zeppa</i>, and knowing well enough
what he had done: or the woman beholding her husband, who easily
heard all their familiar conference, and the action thereupon so
deservedly performed.</p>

<p>See neighbour, is not this your dearest Jewell? Having kept it awhile
in my wives custody; according to my promise, here I deliver
it you. <i>Spinelloccio</i> being glad of his deliverance out of the Chest,
albeit not a little ashamed of himselfe; without using many impertinent
words, saide. <i>Zeppa</i>, our wrongs are equally requited on each
other, and therefore I allow thy former speeches to my Wife, that
thou wast my friend, as I am the like to thee, and so I pray thee let us
still continue. For nothing else is now to bee divided betweene us,
seeing we have shared alike in our wives, which none knowing but
our selves, let it be as closely kept to our selves. <i>Zeppa</i> was wel pleased
with the motion, and so all foure dined lovingly together, without
any variance or discontentment. And thence forward, each of
the Women had two Husbands, as either Husband enjoyed two
Wives, without further contention or debate.</p>

fondly beleeving, that (in the night time) he should bee made
one of a new created Company, who usually went to see wonders, at</i>
Corsica; <i>and there in the Leystall they left him.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Ninth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is approved, that Titles of Honour, Learning, and Dignity,
are not alwayes bestowne on the wisest men.</i></h4>


<p>After that the Ladies had a while considered, on the communication
betweene the two Wives of <i>Sienna</i>, and the
falshood in friendship of their Husbands: the Queene,
who was the last to recount her Novell, without offering injurie to
<i>Dioneus</i>, began to speake thus.</p>

<p>The reward for a precedent Wrong committed, which <i>Zeppa</i> retorted
upon <i>Spinelloccio</i>, was answerable to his desert, and no more
then equity required, in which respect, I am of opinion, that such
men ought not to be over-sharpely reproved, as do injurie to him,
who seeketh for it, and justly should have it, although Madam <i>Pampinea</i>
(not long since) avouched the contrary. Now, it evidently
appeareth, that <i>Spinelloccio</i> well deserved what was done to him,
and I purpose to speake of another, who needs would seeke after his
owne disgrace. The rather to confirme my former speeches, that
they which beguile such wilfull foolish men; are not to bee blamed,
but rather commended. And he unto whom the shame was done,
was a Physitian, which came from <i>Bologna</i> to <i>Florence</i>; and returned
thither againe like unto a Beast, notoriously baffulled and disgraced.</p>

<p>It is a matter well knowne to us, and (almost) observed day by
day, that divers of our Citizens, when they returne from their studying
at <i>Bologna</i>: one becommeth an Advocate, another a Physitian,
and a third a Notarie, with long &amp; large gowns, some of Scarlet,
and hoods furred with Minever, beside divers other great apparances,
succeeding effectually daily in their severall kinds. Among
whom, there returned (not long since) thence, one Master <i>Simon
da Villa</i>, more rich in possessions left him by his parents, then anie
knowledge thereto obtained: yet cloathed in Scarlet, with his Miniver
hood, and styled a Doctor of Physicke, which title hee onely
bestowed on himselfe, and tooke a goodly house for his dwelling,
in the street which wee commonly call <i>La via del Cocomero</i>. This
Master Doctor <i>Simon</i>, being thus newly come thither, among other
notable qualities in him, had one more especiall then any of the
rest, namely, to know the names and conditions of such persons, as
daily passed by his doore, and what professions they were of, whereby
any likelyhood might be gathered of needing his helpe, and being
his patients, observing them all with very vigilant care.</p>

<p>But, among all the rest by him thus warily noted, he most observed
two Painters, of whom we have heeretofore twice discoursed,
<i>Bruno</i> and <i>Buffalmaco</i>, who walked continually together, and were
his neere dwelling neighbours. The matter which most of al he noted
in them, was; that they lived merrily, and with much lesse care,
then any else in the Cittie beside, and verily they did so in deede.
Wherefore, he demanded of divers persons, who had good understanding
of them both, of what estate and condition they were.
And hearing by every one, that they were but poore men &amp; Painters:
he greatly mervailed, how it could be possible for them, that
they should live so jocondly, and in such poverty. It was related to
him further beside, that they were men of a quicke and ingenious
apprehension, whereby hee politikely imagined, that theyr poore
condition could not so well maintaine them; without some courses
else, albeit not publiquely knowne unto men, yet redounding
to their great commoditie and profite. In which regard, he grew
exceeding desirous, by what meanes he might become acquainted,
and grow into familiarity with them both, or any of them, at the
least; wherein (at the length) he prevailed, and <i>Bruno</i> proved to be
the man.</p>

<p>Now <i>Bruno</i> plainly perceiving (within a short while of this new
begun acquaintance) that the Physitian was a Logger-head, and
meerely no better then a <i>Gregorian</i> Animall: he beganne to have
much good pastime with him, by telling him strange and incredible
Tales, such as none but a Coxcombe would give credit too; yet
they delighted Doctor Dunce extraordinarily, and <i>Brunoes</i> familiarity
was so highly pleasing to him, that he was a daily guest at dinner
and supper with him, and hee was not meanly proud of enjoying
his company. One day, as they sate in familiar conference together,
he told <i>Bruno</i> that he wondred not a little at him and <i>Buffalmaco</i>,
they being both so poore people, yet lived far more jovially
then Lords, and therefore desired to understand, by what secret
meanes they compassed such mirthfull maintenance. <i>Bruno</i>,
hearing the Doctors demaund, &amp; perceiving that it favoured more
of the foole, then any the very least taste of wisedome: smiled unto
himselfe, and determined to returne him such an answere, as might
be fitting for his folly, whereupon, thus he replied.</p>

<p>Beleeve me Master Doctor, I would not impart to many people,
what private helpes we have for our maintenance: but yet I dare
boldly acquaint you therewith, in regard you are one of our most
intimate friends, and of such secrecie, as (I know) you will not reveale
it to any. True it is, that mine honest neighbour and my selfe,
do leade our lives in such merry manner as you see, and better then
all the world is aware of, for I cannot imagine you to bee so ignorant,
but are certainly perswaded: that if we had no better means,
then our poore manuall trade and profession; we might sit at home
with bread and water, and be nothing so lively spirited as wee are.
Yet Sir, I would not have you to conceive, that wee do eyther rob
or steale, or use any other unlawfull courses: onely we travayle to
<i>Corsica</i>, from whence we bring (without the least prejudice to anie
other) all things we stand in need of, or whatsoever wee can desire.
Thus do we maintaine our selves well and honestly, and live in this
mirthfull disposition.</p>

<p>Master Doctor hearing this Discourse, and beleeving it constantly,
without any further instruction or intelligence: became possessed
with verie much admiration, and had the most earnest desire in
the world, to know what this Travailing to <i>Corsica</i> might meane:
entreating <i>Bruno</i> with very great instances, to tell him what it
was, and made many protestations never to disclose it to anie one.
How now Master Doctor? answered <i>Bruno</i>, What a strange motion
do you make to mee? It is too great a secret, which you desire
to know, yea, a matter of mine owne ruine, and an utter expulsion
out of this Worlde, with condemnation into the mouth of
<i>Lucifer da San Gallo</i>, if any man whatsoever should know it from
me, wherefore I pray you to urge it no more. O my deer and honest
neighbour <i>Bruno</i> (quoth the Doctor) assure thy selfe upon my soul,
that whatsoever thou revealest to me, shall be under seale from all,
but onely our selves. Fie, fie Master Doctor, answered <i>Bruno</i>, you
are too pressing and importunate. So sitting smiling to himselfe, shaking
his head, and beating his breast, as if hee were in some straunge
distraction of minde, stamping with his feete, and beating his Fiste
oftentimes on the Table, at last he started uppe, and spake in this
manner.</p>

<p>Ah Master Doctor, the love I beare to your capricious and rarely
circumcised experience, and likewise the confidence I repose in
your scrutinous taciturnitie, are both of such mighty and prevailing
power; as I cannot conceale any thing from you, which you covet
to know. And therefore, if you wil sweare unto me by the crosse of
<i>Monteson</i>, that never (as you have already faithfully promised) you
will disclose a secret so admirable; I will relate it unto you, and not
otherwise. The Doctor sware, and sware againe, and then <i>Bruno</i>
thus began.</p>

<p>Know then my learned and judicious Doctor, that it is not long
time since, when there lived in this Citie of ours, a man very excellent
in the Art of Nigromancie, who named himselfe <i>Michale Scoto</i>,
because he was a Scottishman borne, of many woorthy Gentlemen
(very few of them being now living) hee was much honoured
and respected. When he grew desirous to depart from hence, upon
their earnest motion and entreaty; he left here two of his Schollers
behinde him, men of absolute skill and experience: giving them
especiall charge and command, to do all possible services they could
devise, for those Gentlemen who had so highly honoured him. The
two famous Schollers, were very helpefull to those Gentlemen, in
divers of their amorous occasions, and verie many other matters
besides.</p>

<p>Not long after, they finding the Citie, and behaviour of the people
sufficiently pleasing to them; they resolved on their continuance
heere, entering into a league of love and friendshippe with divers,
never regarding, whether they were Gentlemen, or no, or distinguishing
the poore from the rich: but only in being conforme to
their complexions, sociable and fit for friendship.</p>

<p>They created a kinde Society, consisting of about five and twenty
men, who should meete together twice in a moneth, &amp; in a place
reputed convenient for them: where being so assembled, every man
uttered his minde to those two Schollers, in such cases as they most
desired, to have wherewith they were all satisfied the self-same night.
It came so to passe, that <i>Buffalmaco</i> and I, grew into acquaintance
with those two worthy Schollers, and our private familiarity together
proved so prosperous, that we were admitted into the same Society,
and so have ever since continued. Now Sir, I am to tell you
matter deserving admiration, &amp; which (in very good judgements)
would seeme to exceed all beleefe.</p>

<p>For, at every time when we were assembled together: you are
not able to imagine, what sumptuous hangings of Tapistrie, did adorne
the Hall where we sate at meate, the Tables covered in such
Royall manner, waited on by numberlesse Noble and goodly attendants,
both Women and Men, serving readily, at each mans
command of the company. The Basins, Ewers, Pots, Flaggons, &amp;
all the vessels else which stood before, and for the service of our diet,
being composed onely of Gold and Silver, and out of no worse did
we both eate and drinke: the viands being very rare and dainty, abounding
in plenty and variety, according to the appetite of everie
person, as nothing could be wished for, but it was instantly obtained.</p>

<p>In good sadnesse Sir, I am not able to remember and tell you
(within the compasse of a thousand yeares) what, and how manie
severall kindes of Musicall Instruments, were continually played on
before us; what multiplicity of Waxe lights burned in all partes of
the roomes; neither the excessive store of rich Drugs, Marchpanes,
Comfites, and rare Banquetting stuffe, consumed there at one Feasting,
wherein there wanted no bounty of the best and purest wines.
Nor do I (Master Doctor) repute you so weakly witted, as to think,
that in the time of our being thus assembled there, any of us al were
cloathed in such simple and meane Garments, as ordinarily are
worne in the streets on mens bodies, or any so silly as the verie best
you have: No Sir, not any one man among us, but appeared by his
apparrell, equall to the greatest Emperour on the earth, his robe
most sumptuously imbroidered with precious stones, Pearles, and
Carbuncles, as all the world affoordeth not the like. But above all
the rest, the delights and pleasures there, are beyond my capacity to
expresse, or (indeede) any comparison: as namely, store of goodly
and beautifull women, brought thither from all parts of the world;
alwayes provided, if men bee desirous of their company: but for
your easier comprehension, I will make some briefe relation of them
to you, according as I heard them there named.</p>

<p>There is the great Lady of <i>Barbanicchia</i>; the Queene of <i>Baschia</i>;
the Wife to the great <i>Soldane</i>, the Empresse of <i>Osbeccho</i>; the <i>Ciancianfera</i>
of <i>Norniera</i>; the <i>Bemistante</i> of <i>Berlinzona</i>; and the <i>Scalpedra</i>
of <i>Narsia</i>. But why do I breake my braine, in numbering up so
many to you? All the Queenes of the world are there, even so farre
as to the <i>Schinchimurra</i> of <i>Prester John</i>, that hath a horne in the
midst of her posteriores, albeit not visible to every eye.</p>

<p>Now I am further to tell you, that after we have tasted a Cup of
precious Wine, fed on a few delicate Comfits, and danced a dance
or two to the rare Musicke: every one taketh a Lady by the hand,
of whom he pleaseth to make his election, and she conducteth him
to her Chamber, in very grave and gracious manner. Concerning
the Chambers there, each of them resembleth a Paradise to looke
on, they are so faire and goodly; and no lesse odorifferous in smell,
then the sweetest perfumes in your Apothecaries shoppes, or the
rare compounds of Spices, when they are beaten in an open Morter.
And as for the Beds, they are infinitely richer, then the verie
costliest belonging to the Duke of <i>Venice</i>: yet (in such) each man is
appointed to take his rest, the Musicke of rare Cymbals lasting all
night long, much better to be by you considered, then in my rude
eloquence expressed.</p>

<p>But of all those rich and sumptuous Beds (if pride of mine owne
opinion do not deceive me) them two provided for <i>Buffalmaco</i> and
me, had hardly any equall: he having the Queene of <i>France</i> as his
Lady and Mistresse, and I, the renowned Queene of <i>England</i>, the
onely two choise beauties of the whole World, and wee appeared
so pleasing in their eyes, as they would have refused the greatest
Monarkes on the earth, rather then to bee rejected by us. Now
therefore, you may easily consider with your selfe, what great reason
we have to live more merrily, then any other men can doe: in
regard we enjoy the gracious favour of two such Royall Queenes,
receyving also from them (whensoever wee please to commaund
them) a thousand or two thousand Florines at the least, which are
both truly and duly sent us. Enjoying thus the benefit of this high
happinesse, we that are companions of this Society, do tearme it in
our vulgar Language, <i>The Pyrats voyage to Corsica</i>. Because, as
Rovers or Pyrats robbe and take away the goodes of such as they
meete withall, even so do we: only there remaineth this difference
betweene us, that they never restore what they have taken: which
we do immediately afterward, whether it be required or no. And
thus Master Doctor, as to my most endeered friend, I have now revealed
the meaning of sayling to <i>Corsica</i>, after the manner of our
private Pyracie, and how important the close retention of the voiage
is, you are best able your selfe to judge: In which regarde, remember
your Oathes and faithfull promises, or else I am undone
forever.</p>

<p>Our worthy wise Doctor, whose best skill scarsely extended so
farre, as to cure the itch in Children; gave such sound beleefe to
the relation of <i>Bruno</i>, as any man could doe, to the most certaine
truth of life or death: having his desire immeasurably enflamed,
to bee made a member of this straunge Societie, which hee more
coveted, then any thing in the world beside, accounting it a felicity
farre beyond all other.</p>

<p>Whereupon he answered <i>Bruno</i>, that it was no great matter of
mervaile, if he lived so merrily as he did, having such a singular supply,
to avoide all necessities whatsoever: and very hardly could he
refraine from immediate request, to be accepted into the company.
But yet he thought fit to deferre it further, untill he had made <i>Bruno</i>
more beholding to him, by friendly entertainments and other
courtesies, when he might (with better hope) be bold to move the
motion.</p>

<p>Well may you conceive, that nothing more hammerd in the Doctors
head, then this rare voyage to <i>Corsica</i>, and <i>Bruno</i> was his daily
guest at dinner and supper, with such extraordinary apparances
of kindnesse and courtesie, as if the Physitian could not live, except
he had the company of <i>Bruno</i>. Who seeing himselfe to bee so lovingly
respected, and hating ingratitude, for favours so abundantly
heaped on him: hee painted the whole story of Lent about his
Hall, and an <i>Agnus Dei</i> fairely gilt, on the portall of his Chamber,
as also a goodly Urinall on his street doore, to the end, that such as
had neede of his counsell, might know where so judicious a Doctour
dwelt. In a Gallery likewise by his Garden, he painted the furious
Battaile betweene the Rats and Cats, which did (not a little) delight
Master Doctor.</p>

<p>Moreover, at such times as Bruno had not supt with our Physitian,
he would bee sure to tell him on the morrow, that the night passed,
he had bin with the Company which he did wot of. And there
(quoth he) the Queene of <i>England</i> having somewhat offended mee,
I commanded, that the <i>Gomedra</i>, belonging to the <i>Grand Cham</i> of
<i>Tartaria</i>, should be brought me, and instantly shee was. What
may be the meaning of <i>Gomedra</i> be? saide the Doctor, I understand
not those difficult names. I beleeve you Sir, answered <i>Bruno</i>, nor
do I need to marvaile thereat: and yet I have heard <i>Porcograsso</i>
speake, and also <i>Vannacenna</i>, and both unexperienced in our Language.
You would say (replyed the Doctour) <i>Hippocrates</i> and <i>Avicenna</i>,
who were two admirable Physitians. It may be so (said <i>Bruno</i>)
&amp; as hardly do I understand your names, as you mine: but <i>Gomedra</i>,
in the <i>Grand Chams</i> language, signifies Empresse in ours. But
had you once seene her Sir, she would make you forget all Physicall
observations, your arguments, receits and medicines, onely to be in
her heavenly presence, which words he used (perceiving his forward
longing) to enflame him the more. Not long after, as the doctor was
holding the candle to <i>Bruno</i>, at the perfecting the bloody Battayle
of the Cattes and Rattes, because he could never bee wearied in his
Companie, and therefore was the more willing, to undergoe the
office of the Candle-holder: he resolved to acquaint him with his
minde, and being all alone by themselves, thus he began.</p>

<p><i>Bruno</i>, as heaven knoweth, there is not this day any creature living,
for whom I would gladly do more, then for thee, and the very
least word of thy mouth, hath power to commaund mee to goe
bare-footed, even from hence so farre as to <i>Peretola</i>, and account
my labour well employed for thy sake: wherefore, never wonder
at my continuall kindnesse towards thee, using thee as my Domesticke
companion, and embracing thee as my bosome friend, and
therefore I am the bolder in mooving one request unto thee. As
thou well knowest, it is no long while since, when thou diddest acquaint
me with the behaviour of the <i>Corsicane</i> Roving Company,
to be one in so rare and excellent a Society, such hath bin my earnest
longing ever since, as day nor night have I enjoyed anie rest,
but should thinke my felicity beyond all compare, if I could be entertained
in fellowship among you.</p>

<p>Nor is this desire of mine but upon great occasion, as thou thy
selfe shalt perceive, if I prove accepted into your Societie, and let
me then be made a mocking stocke for ever, if I cause not to come
thither, one of the most delicate young women, that ever anie eye
beheld, and which I my selfe saw (not above a yeare since) at <i>Cacavinciglia</i>,
on whom I bestowed my intirest affection, and (by the
best Urinall that ever I gazed on) would have given her tenne faire
<i>Bologninaes</i>, to yeeld the matter I moved to her, which yet I could
not (by any meanes) compasse. Therefore, with all the flowing faculties
of my soule I entreate thee, and all the very uttermost of my
all indeede; to instruct me in those wayes and meanes, whereby I
may hope to be a member of you. Which if thou dooest accomplish
for me, and I may finde it effectually performed: I shall not
onely be thy true and loyall friend for ever, but will honour thee
beside, beyond all men living.</p>

<p>I know thee to bee a man of judgement, deepely informed in all
well-grounded experience: thou seest what a propper, portly, and
comely man I am, how fitly my legges are answerable to my body,
my lookes amiable, lovely, and of Rosie colour; beside I am a Doctor
of Physicke, of which profession (being only most expedient)
I thinke you have not one in your Society. I have many commendable
qualities in me, as, playing on divers instruments, exquisite in
singing, and composing rare ditties, whereof I will instantly sing
thee one. And so he began to sing.</p>

<p><i>Bruno</i> was swolne so bigge with desire of laughter, that hee had
scarsely any power to refraine from it: neverthelesse, he made the
best meanes he could devise: and the Song being ended, the Physition
saide. How now <i>Bruno</i>? What is thine Opinion of my singing?
Beleeve me Sir, replyed <i>Bruno</i>, the Vialles of <i>Sagginali</i>, will
loose their very best tunes, in contending against you, so mirilifficially
are the sweet accents of your voice heard. I tell thee truly <i>Bruno</i>
(answered Master Doctor) thou couldst not by any possibility have
beleeved it, if thou hadst not heard it. In good sadness Sir (said <i>Bruno</i>)
you speake most truly. I could (quoth the Doctor) sing thee infinite
more beside, but at this time I must forbeare them. Let mee
then further informe thee <i>Bruno</i>, that beside the compleat perfections
thou seest in me, my father was a Gentleman, although he dwelt
in a poore Country village, and by my mothers side, I am derived
from them of <i>Vallecchio</i>. Moreover, as I have formerly shewn thee,
I have a goodly Library of Bookes, yea, and so faire and costly garments,
as few Physitians in <i>Florence</i> have the like. I protest to thee
upon my faith, I have one gowne, which cost me (in readie money)
almost an hundred poundes in <i>Bagattinoes</i>, and it is not yet above
ten yeares old. Wherefore let me prevaile with thee, good <i>Bruno</i>,
to worke so with the rest of thy friends, that I may bee one of your
singular Society; and, by the honest trust thou reposest in mee, bee
boldly sick whensoever thou wilt, my paines and Physicke shall be
freely thine, without the payment of one single peny. <i>Bruno</i> hearing
his importunate words, and knowing him (as all men else did
beside) to be a man of more words then wit, saide. Master Doctor,
snuffe the candle I pray you, and lend me a little more light with it
hitherward, until I have finished the tailes of these Rats, and then I
wil answer you.</p>

<p>When the Rats tailes were fully finished, <i>Bruno</i> declaring by outward
behaviour, that he greatly distasted the matter mooved, thus
answered. Worthy Master Doctor, the courtesies you have already
extended towards me, and the bountifull favours promised beside,
I know to be exceeding great, and farre beyond the compasse
of any merit in me. But concerning your request, albeit in respect
of your admired braine and Wisedome, it is of little or no moment
at all; yet it appeareth over-mighty to mee, and there is not
any man now living in the world, that hath the like Authoritie over
me, and can more commaund me, then you (with one poore
syllable) easily may doe: as well in regarde of my Love and Dutie,
as also your singular and sententious speeches, able not onelie
to make me breake a sound and setled resolution, but (almost) to
move Mountaines out of their places, and the more I am in your
Learned company, so much the faster am I lincked unto you, in
immoveable affection, so farre am I in love with your admirable
qualities. And had I no other reason, to affect you in such endeared
manner, as I doe; yet because you are enamoured of
so rare a beauty, as you have already related to me, it onely were a
motive sufficient to compell me. But indeed I must needs tel you,
that I have not so much power in this case, as you (perhaps) do imagine,
which barreth me from such forward readines, as otherwise
needed not to be urged. Neverthelesse, having so solemnly ingaged
your faith to me, and no way misdoubting your faithfull secrecy, I
shall instruct you in some meanes to be observed; and it appeareth
plainly to me, that being furnished with such plenty of Bookes, as
you are, and other rich endowments, as you have before rehearsed,
you cannot but attaine to the full period of your longing desire.</p>

<p>Speake boldly thy minde <i>Bruno</i>, answered the Doctour: for, I
perceive thou hast no perfect knowledge of me as yet, neither what
an especiall gift I have of secrecy. <i>Messer Gasparino da Salicete</i>, when
he was Judge and Potestat over the people of <i>Forlini</i>, made choise
of mee (among infinite of his dearest friends) to acquaint with a secret
of no meane moment. And such a faithfull Secretary he found
me, as I was the onely man, that knew his mariage with <i>Bergamino</i>;
why then should any distrust be made of me? If it be so as you say
Sir (answered <i>Bruno</i>) your credit is the sounder, and I dare the better
adventure on your fidelity: the meanes then which you are to
worke by, I shall now direct you in.</p>

<p>We have alwayes in this noble Society of ours, a Captaine, and
two Counsellors, which are changed at every six months end. And
now at Christmas next (so neere drawing on) <i>Buffalmaco</i> shal be elected
Captaine, and my selfe one of the Counsellers, for so it is already
agreed on, and orderly set downe. Now, he that is Captain,
may doe much more then any other can, and appoint matters as
himselfe pleaseth. Wherefore I thinke it very expedient, that so
soone as possibly you may, you procure acquaintance with <i>Buffalmaco</i>,
entreating him with all respective courtesie. Hee is a man,
who when he perceyveth you to be so wonderfully Wise and discreete,
he will be immediately in love with you: so, when you have
your best senses about you, and your richest wearing Garments
on (alwayes remembred, that your acquaintance first be fully confirmed)
then never feare to urge your request, for he can have no
power at all to denie you; because I have already spoken of you
to him, and find him to stand affected unto you verie intirely: thus
when you have begunne the businesse, leave me to deale with him
in the rest.</p>

<p>Now trust me kinde friend <i>Bruno</i>, replyed the Physitian, I like
your advice exceeding well. For, if hee be a man, that taketh delight
to converse with men of skill and judgement, and you have
made the way for his knowing me: he wil then thirst, and long to
follow after mee, to understand the incredible eloquence flowing
from me, and the rare composition of my Musicall Ditties, out of
which he may learne no meane wisedome. When the matter was
thus agreed on betweene them, <i>Bruno</i> departed thence, &amp; acquainted
<i>Buffalmaco</i> with everie circumstance: which made him thinke
everie day a yeare, untill he might joyne in the fooling of Mayster
Doctour, according to his owne fancie. Who beeing also as
desirous on the other side, to make one in the <i>Corsicane</i> Voyage;
could take no manner of rest either by day or night, till he was linked
in friendship with <i>Buffalmaco</i>, which very quickely after hee
compassed.</p>

<p>For now there wanted no costly dinners and suppers, with al delicates
could be devised, for the entertainement of <i>Buffalmaco</i> and
<i>Bruno</i>; who, like Guests very easie to be invited, where rich wines
and good cheare are never wanting, needed little sending for, because
his house was as familiar to them, as their owne. In the
end, when the Physitian espyed an opportunitie apt for the purpose,
he made the same request to <i>Buffalmaco</i>, as formerly hee had
done to <i>Bruno</i>. Whereat <i>Buffalmaco</i>, sodainly starting, and looking
frowningly on <i>Bruno</i>, as if he were extraordinarily incensed against
him: clapping his hand furiously on the Table, he sayde. I
sweare by the great God of <i>Pasignano</i>, that I can hardly refrayne
from giving thee such a blow on the face, as should make thy Nose
to fall at thy heeles: vile Traitor as thou art: for none beside thy
selfe, could discover so rare and excellent a secret unto this famous
Physitian. The Doctour, with verie plausible and pleasing
tearmes, excused the matter verie artificially; protesting, that another
had revealed it unto him: and after many wise circumstantiall
Allegations, at length hee prevailed so farre, that <i>Buffalmaco</i>
was pacified; who afterwardes turning in kinde manner, thus hee
beganne.</p>

<p>Master Doctour, you have lived both at <i>Bologna</i>, and heere in
these partes with us, having (no doubt) sufficiently understoode,
what it is to carry a close mouth, I meane the true Charracter of taciturnitie.
Questionlesse, you never learned the A. B. C. as now
foolish Ideots do, blabbing their lessons all about the towne, which
is much better apprehended by rumination; and surely (if I be not
much deceyved) your Nativity happened on a Sonday morning,
Sol being at that time, Lord of the ascendent, joyned with <i>Mercurie</i>
in a fierie Triplicitie. By such conference as I have had with
<i>Bruno</i>, I conceyved (as he himselfe also did) that you were verie
singular in Physicke onely: but it seemeth, your Studies reached
a higher straine, for you have learned, and know verie skilfullie,
how to steale mens hearts from them, yea, to bereave them of
their verie soules, which I perceyve that you can farre better doe,
then any man else living to my knowledge, only by your wise, witty,
judicious, and more then meere <i>Mercurian</i> eloquence, such as I
never heard before.</p>

<p>The Physitian interrupting him bashfully, turned himselfe unto
<i>Bruno</i>, saying. Did not I tell thee this before? Observe what a notable
thing it is, to speake well, and to frequent the company of the
Wise. A thousand other, meerely blockes and dullardes by Nature,
could never so soone comprehend all the particularities of my
knowledge, as this honest and apprehensive man hath done. Thou
didst not search into it halfe so soone, nor (indeed) did I expresse a
quarter of my ingenuity to thee, as (since his comming) hath prodigally
flowne from me.</p>

<p>Well do I remember thy words, that <i>Buffalmaco</i> delighted to be
among men of Wisedome: and have I not now fitted him unto his
owne desire? How thinkest thou <i>Bruno</i>? The best (quoth <i>Bruno</i>)
that any man living in the World could do. Ah worthy <i>Buffalmaco</i>,
answered the Physitian: What wouldst thou then have sayde, if
thou hadst seene me at <i>Bologna</i>, where there was neyther great nor
small, Doctor nor Scholler, but thought themselves happy by being
in my company? If I ought any debts, I discharged them with
my very wittie words; and whensoever I spake, I could set them al
on a hearty laughter, so much pleasure they tooke in hearing mee.
And when I departed thence, no men in the world could bee more
sorrowfull then they, as desiring nothing more then my remayning
among them, which they expressed so apparantly, that they made
humble suite and intercession to me, to bee cheefe Reader of the
Physicke-Lecture, to all the Schollers studying our profession. But
I could not be so perswaded, because my minde was wholly addicted
hither, to enjoy those Goods, Landes, and Inheritances, belonging
lineally to them of our house, and accordingly I did performe
it.</p>

<p>How now <i>Buffalmaco</i> (quoth <i>Bruno</i>) what is thine opinion now?
Thou wouldst not beleeve me when I told thee, that there is not a
Doctor in all these parts, more skilfull in distinguishing the Urine
of an Asse, from any other, then this most expert and singular man:
and I dare boldly maintaine it, that his fellow is not to bee found,
from hence to the very gates of <i>Paris</i>. Go then, and doe the uttermost
endeavour that thou canst, to grant the request which he hath
made.</p>

<p>Beleeve me <i>Buffalmaco</i>, saide the Doctor, <i>Bruno</i> hath spoken nothing
but truth, for I am scarsely knowne heere in this City, where
(for the most part) they are all grosse-witted people, rather then any
jot judicious; but I would thou hadst seene me among the Doctors,
in manner as I was wont to be. Introth Sire, replyed <i>Buffalmaco</i>,
you are my much more Learned then ever I imagined, in which
respect, speaking unto you as it becommeth me, to a man so excellent
in wit and understanding: I dare assure you that (without any
faile) I wil procure you to be one of our Company.</p>

<p>After this promise thus made, the good cheare, favours and kindnesses
done by the Doctor to them, was beyond the compasse of all
relation: whereof they made no more then a meere mockery, flouting
him to his face, and yet his Wisedome could not discerne it.
Moreover, they promised, that they would give him to Wife, the
faire Countesse <i>di Civillari</i>, who was the onely goodliest creature
to be found in the whole <i>Culattario</i> of humane generation. The
Doctor demanded, what Countesse that was? Oh Sir, answered
<i>Buffalmaco</i>, she is a great Lady, one worthy to have issue by; and
few houses are there in the world, where she hath not some jurisdiction
and command: so that not meane people onely, but even the
greatest Lords, at the sound of her Trumpets, do very gladlie pay
her tribute. And I dare boldly affirme, that whensoever shee walketh
to any place, shee yeeldeth a hot and sensible favour, albeit she
keepeth most of all close. Yet once every night, shee duely observeth
it (as a Custome) to passe from her owne house, to bathe her
feete in the River of <i>Arno</i>, and take a little of the sweeter Ayre:
albeit her continuall residencie, is within the Kingdome of <i>Laterino</i>.</p>

<p>She seldome walketh abroad, but goeth with her attending Officers
about her, who (for more demonstration of her greatnesse) do
carry the Rod and plummet of Lead. Store of her Lords and Barons
are every where to be seene; as the <i>Tamagaino della porta, Don
Meta di Sirropa; Manico di Scopa; Signior Squacchera,</i> and others
beside, who are (as I suppose) oftentimes your daily visitants, when
of necessity they must be remembred. All our care and courtesie
shall extend so farre (if we doe not faile in our enterprize) to leave
you in the armes of so Majestick a Ladie, quite forgetting hir of <i>Cacavinciglia</i>.</p>

<p>The Physitian, who was borne and brought up at <i>Bologna</i>, and
therefore understoode not these <i>Florentine</i> tearmes: became fully
contented to enjoy the Ladie; and, within some few dayes following,
the Painters brought him tydings, that they had prepared the
way for his entertainment into the Societie of Rovers. The day
being come, when the supposed assembly was to be made the night
following: the Physitian invited them both to dinner; when he demanding,
what provision he shold make for his entrance into their
company, <i>Buffalmaco</i> returned him this answer, whereto he gave
very heedfull attention.</p>

<p>Master Doctor, you must be first of all, strongly armed with resolution
and confidence: for if you be not, you may not only receyve
hindrance, but also do us great harme beside: and now you
shall heare, in what manner, and how you are to be bold and constant.
You must procure the meanes, this instant night, when all
the people are in their soundest sleepe, to stand upon one of those
high exalted Tombs or Monuments, which are in the Churchyard
of <i>Santa Maria Novella</i>, with the very fairest gowne you have about
you, because you may appeare in the more honourable condition,
before the assembly seated together, and likewise to make good
our speeches already delivered of you, concerning your qualitie &amp;
profession: that the Countesse, perceyving you to bee a woorthie
Gentlemen, may have you first honoured with the Bathe, and afterward
Knighted at her owne cost and charge. But you must continue
stil upon the Tombe (dreadlesse of nightly apparitions &amp; visions)
untill such time as we send for you.</p>

<p>And for your better information in every particulare; a Beast,
blacke and horned, but of no great stature, will come to fetch you:
perhaps he will use some gastly noises, straunge leapes, and loftie
trickes, onely to terrifie and affright you: but when he perceiveth
that he cannot daunt you, hee will gently come neere you, which
when he hath done, you may descend from off the Tombe; and,
without naming or thinking on God, or any of his Saintes, mount
boldly on his backe, for he will stand ready to receive you. Being
so seated, crosse your armes over your brest, without presuming to
touch or handle the Beast, for he will carry you thence softly, and
so bring you along to the company. But if in all this time of your
travaile, you call on heaven, any Saint, or bee possessed with the
least thought of feare: I must plainely tell you, that either hee will
cast you dangerously, or throw you into some noysome place. And
therefore, if you know your selfe, not to be of a constant courage,
and sprightly bold, to undertake such an adventure as this: never
presume any further, because you may doe us a great deale of injurie,
without any gaine or benefite to your selfe, but rather such
wrong, as we would be very sorry should happen unto so deere a
Friend.</p>

<p>Alas honest <i>Buffalmaco</i>, answered the Physitian, thou art not halfe
acquainted with me as yet: because I walke with gloves upon my
hands, and in a long Gowne, thou perhappes doest imagine mee a
faint-hearted fellow. If thou didst know, what I have heeretofore
done at <i>Bologna</i> in the night time, when I and my Consorts went
to visite pretty wenches, thou wouldst wonder at my couragious
attempts. As I am a Gentleman, one night, we met with a young
<i>Bona Roba</i>, a paltry greene-sicknesse baggage, scarsely above a Cubite
in height, &amp; because she refused to go with us willingly, I gave
her a kicke on the bum, and spurnde her more then a Crosse-bowe
shoote in distance from me, and made her walke with us whether
she would, or no. Another time I remember, when having no other
company but my boy, I went thorow the Churchyard of the
Fryars Minors, after the sounding of <i>Ave Maria</i>: a woman hadde
beene buried there the very same day, and yet I was not a jotte affraid.</p>

<p>Wherefore, never be distrustfull of mee, but resolvedly builde
upon my courage. And in regard of my more honourable entertainment,
I will then weare my Scarlet Gowne and Hood, wherein
I receyved my graduation; and then do both of you observe, what
a rejoycing will be among the whole company, at the entertaining
of such as a man as I am, enough to create me Captaine immediately.
You shall perceive also how the case will go, after I have beene
there but a while, in regard that the Countesse (having as yet never
seene me) is so deepely enamored of mee: she cannot choose but
bestow the Bathe and Knight-hood on me, which shee shall have
the more honour of, in regard I am well able to maintaine it, therefore
referre all the rest to mee, and never misdoubt your injurie or
mine.</p>

<p>Spoken like a Gallant, replyed <i>Buffalmaco</i>, and I feare not now,
but we shall winne credite by your company. But be carefull I pray
you, that you make not a mockery of us, and come not at all, or
fayle to be there, when the Beast shall be sent for you; I speake it
the rather, because it is cold weather, and you Gentlemen Physitians
can hardly endure it. You are carefull of mee (quoth the Doctor)
and I thanke you for it, but I applaud my faire Starres, I am
none of your nice or easie-frozen fellowes, because cold weather is
very familiar to me. I dare assure you, when I arise in the night time
for that naturall office whereto all men are subject, I weare no warmer
defence, then my thin wastcoat over my shirt, and finde it sufficient
for the coldest weather at any time.</p>

<p>When <i>Bruno</i> and <i>Buffalmaco</i> had taken their leave, the Physitian,
so soone as night drew neere, used many apt excuses to his wife,
stealing forth his Scarlet Gowne and Hood unseene of any, wherewith
being clothed: at the time appointed, he got upon one of the
Marble Tombes, staying there (quaking with cold) awaiting when
the Beast should come. <i>Buffalmaco</i>, being a lusty tall man of person,
had got an ugly masking suite, such as are made use of in Tragedies
and Playes, the out-side being of black shagged haire, wherewith
being cloathed, he seemed like a strange deformed Beare, and
a Divels vizard over his face, with two gastly horrible hornes, and
thus disguised, <i>Bruno</i> following him, they went to behold the issue
of the businesse, so farre as the new Market place, closely adjoining
to <i>Santa Maria Novella</i>.</p>

<p>Having espyed Master Doctor uppon the Tombe, <i>Buffalmaco</i> in
his misshapen habite, began to bound, leape, and carriere, snuffling
and blowing in mad and raging manner: which when the Physitian
saw, his haire stood on end, he quaked and trembled, as being
more fearfull then a Woman, wishing himselfe at home againe in
his house, rather then to behold a sight so dreadfull. But because he
was come forth, and had such an earnest desire, to see the wonders
related to him; he made himselfe so coragious as possibly he could,
and bare all out in formall manner. After that <i>Buffalmaco</i> had (an
indifferent while) plaide his horse-trickes, ramping and stamping
somewhat strangely: seeming as become of much milder temper,
he went neere to the Tomb whereon the Physitian stood, and there
appeared to stay contentedly.</p>

<p>Master Doctor, trembling and quaking still extreamely, was so
farre dismayed, as he knew not what was best to be done, either to
mount on the beasts backe, or not to mount at all. In the end, thinking
no harme could happen to him, if he were once mounted, with
the second feare, hee expelled the former, and descending downe
softly from the Tombs, mounted on the beast, saying out alowde:
God, Saint Dominicke, and my good Angell helpe to defend mee.
Seating himselfe so well as he could, but trembling still exceedingly;
he crossed his armes over his stomacke, according to the Lesson
given him.</p>

<p>Then did <i>Buffalmaco</i> shape his course in milde manner, toward
<i>Santa Maria della Scala</i>, and groping to finde his way in the darke,
went on so farre as the Sisters of <i>Ripole</i>, commonly called the <i>Virgin
Sanctuary</i>. Not farre off from thence, were divers trenches &amp;
ditches, wherein such men as are imployed in necessary night-services,
used to empty the Countesse <i>di Civillari</i>, and afterward imployed
it for manuring Husbandmens grounds. <i>Buffalmaco</i>, being
come neere one of them, he stayed to breath himselfe awhile, and
then catching fast hold on one of the Doctours feete, raysed him
somewhat higher on his back, for the easier discharging of his burthen,
and so pitched him (with his head forwardes) into the Lay-stall.</p>

<p>Then began he to make a dreadfull kinde of noise, stamping and
trampling with his feete, passing backe againe to <i>Santa Maria della
Scala</i>, and to <i>Prato d'Ognissanti</i>, where hee met with <i>Bruno</i>, who
was constrained to forsake him, because he could not refraine from
lowde Laughter, then both together went backe once more, to see
how the Physitian would behave himselfe, being so sweetely embrued.</p>

<p>Master Doctor, seeing himselfe to bee in such an abhominable
stinking place, laboured with all his utmost endevour, to get himself
released thence: but the more he contended and strove for getting
forth, he plunged himselfe the further in, being most pitifully myred
from head to foot, sighing and sorrowing extraordinarily, because
much of the foule water entred in at his mouth. In the end,
being forced to leave his hood behinde him, scrambling both with
his hands and feet, he got landing out of his stinking Labyrinth, &amp;
having no other means, home he returned to his own house, where
knocking at the doore, he was at length admitted entrance. The
doore being scarse made fast againe after his letting in, <i>Buffalmaco</i>
and <i>Bruno</i> were there arrived, listning how M. Doctor should bee
welcomd home by his angry wife: who scolding and railing at him
with wonderfull impatience, gave him most hard and bitter speeches,
terming him the vilest man living.</p>

<p>Where have you bin Sir? quoth she. Are you become a night-walker
after other Women? And could no worse garments serve
your turne, but your Doctors gown of Scarlet? Am I to suffer this
behaviour? Or am not I sufficient to content you, but you must be
longing after change? I would thou hadst bin stifled in that foule
filth, where thy fouler life did justly cast thee. Behold goodly Master
Doctor of the Leystall, who being maried to an honest woman
must yet go abroad in the night time, insatiatly lusting after whores
and harlots. With these and the like intemperate speeches, she ceased
not to afflict and torment him, till the night was almost spent,
and the Doctor brought into a sweeter savour.</p>

<p>The next morning, <i>Bruno</i> and <i>Buffalmaco</i>, having colourd their
bodyes with a strange kinde of painting, resembling blisters, swellings,
and bruises, as if they had bin extreamly beaten; came to the
Physitians house, finding him to be newly up, al the house yet smelling
of his foule savour (although it had bin very well perfumed)
and being admitted to him in the Garden, hee welcommed them
with the mornings salutations. But <i>Bruno</i> and <i>Buffalmaco</i> (being otherwise
provided for him) delivering stearne and angry lookes,
stamping and chafing, <i>Bruno</i> thus replyed.</p>

<p>Never speake so faire and flattering to us, for we are moved beyond
all compasse of patience. All misfortunes in the worlde fall
upon you, and an evill death may you dye, like the most false and
perfidious Traitor living on the earth. We must beate our braines,
and move all our most endeared friends, onely for your honour and
advancement: while wee were well neere starved to death in the
cold like Dogs, and, by your breach of promise, have bin this night
so extreamly beaten, as if (like Asses) we should have beene driven
to <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p>But that which is most greevous of all, is danger of excluding
out of the Society, where wee tooke good order for your admittance,
and for your most honourable entertainment. If you wil not
credit us, behold our bodies, and let your owne eyes be witnesses,
in what cruell manner we have bin beaten. So taking him aside under
the Gallery, where they might not be discovered by over-much
light, they opened their bosomes, shewed him their painted bodies,
and sodainly closed them up againe.</p>

<p>The Physitian laboured to excuse himselfe, declaring his misfortunes
at large, and into what a filthy place he was throwne. It maketh
no matter (answered <i>Buffalmaco</i>) I would you had bin throwen
from off the Bridge into <i>Arno</i>, where you might have beene
recommended to the Divell, and all his Saints. Did not I tell you
so much before. In good sadnesse (quoth the Doctor) I neyther
commended my selfe to God, nor any of his Saints. How? sayde
<i>Buffalmaco</i>, I am sure you will maintaine an untrueth, you used a
kinde of recommendation: for our messenger told us, that you talked
of God, S. <i>Dominicke</i>, and your good Angell, whom you desired
to assist you, being so affrighted with feare, that you trembled
like a leafe upon a tree, not knowing indeede where you were. Thus
have you unfaithfully dealt with us, as never any man shall doe the
like againe, in seeking honour, and losing it through your own negligence.</p>

<p>Master Doctor humbly entreated pardon, and that they would
not revile him any more, labouring to appease them by the best
words he could use, as fearing least they should publish this great
disgrace of him. And whereas (before) he gave them gracious welcomes;
now he redoubled them with farre greater courtesies, feasting
them daily at his own table, and evermore delighting in their
company. Thus (as you have heard) two poore Painters of <i>Florence</i>,
taught Master Doctor better Wit, then all the Learned at
<i>Bologna</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="A_Cicilian_Courtezane_named_Madame_Biancafiore_by_her_craftie" id="A_Cicilian_Courtezane_named_Madame_Biancafiore_by_her_craftie"><i>A Cicilian Courtezane, named Madame</i> Biancafiore, <i>by her craftie
wit and policie, deceived a young Merchant, called</i> Salabetto, <i>of all
the money he had taken for his Wares at</i> Palermo. <i>Afterward, he
making shew of comming hither againe, with farre richer Merchandises
then hee brought before: made the meanes to borrow a
great summe of Money of her, leaving her so base a pawne, as well
requited her for her former cozenage.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Tenth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Whereby appeareth, that such as meet with cunning Harlots, and suffer
themselves to be deceived by them: must sharpen their Wits, to
make them requitall in the selfesame kinde.</i></h4>


<p>Needlesse it were to question, whether the Novell related
by the Queene, in divers passages thereof, mooved the
Ladies to hearty laughter, and likewise to compassionate
sighes and teares; as pittying Madame <i>Helena</i> in her hard misfortune,
and yet applauding the Scholler for his just revenge. But
the discourse being ended, <i>Dioneus</i>, who knew it was his Office to
be the last speaker every day, after silence was commanded, he began
in this manner.</p>

<p>Worthy Ladies, it is a matter very manifest, that deceits do appeare
so much the more pleasing, when (by the selfe-same meanes)
the subtle deceyver is artificially deceived. In which respect, though
you all have reported very singular deceits: yet I meane to tel you
one, that may prove as pleasing to you, as any of your owne. And
so much the rather, because the woman deceived, was a great and
cunning Mistris in beguiling others; equalling (if not excelling) any
of your former beguilers.</p>

<p>It hath bene observed heretofore, and (happily) at this very day
it is as frequent, that in all Cities and Townes upon the Sea-coasts,
having Ports for the benefit and venting Merchandises; Merchants
use to bring their wealthy laden Vessels thither. And when they
unlade any Ship of great fraught, there are prepared Store-houses,
which in many places are called <i>Magazines</i> or <i>Doganaes</i>, at the
charge of the Communalty, or Lord of the Towne or City, for the
use whereof, they receive yearly gain and benefit. Into those warehouses,
they deliver (under writing, and to the owners of them in especiall
charge) all their goods and merchandises, of what price or
valew soever they are.</p>

<p>Such as be the Owners of these Magazines, when the Wares are
thus stored uppe in them, doe safely locke them up there with their
keyes, having first registred downe truly all the goods, in the Register
belonging to the Custome-house, that the Merchant may have
a just account rendred him, and the rights payed to the Custome-house,
according to the Register, and as they are either in part, or
in all made sale of.</p>

<p>Brokers are continually there attending, being informed in the
quality of the Merchandises stored, and likewise to what Merchants
they appertaine: by meanes of these men, and according as the
goods come to their hands, they devise to have them exchaunged,
trucked, vented, and such other kinds of dispatches, answerable to
the mens minds, and worth of the Commodities. As in many other
Kingdomes and Countries, so was this custome observed at
<i>Palermo</i> in <i>Sicily</i>, where likewise then were, and (no doubt) now a-dayes
are, store of Women, faire and comely of person, but yet
vowed enemies to honesty.</p>

<p>Neverthelesse, by such as know them not, they are held and reputed
to be blamelesse Women, and by yeilding their bodyes unto
generall use, are the occasion of infinite misfortunes to men. For
so soone as they espy a Merchant-stranger there arrived, they win
information from the Booke belonging to the Magazin, what wares
are therein stored, of what valew they bee, and who is the Owner
of them. Afterwards, by amorous actions, and affable speeches,
they allure young Merchants to take knowledge of them, to bee familiar
in their company, till from some they get most part of their
wealth, from others all. Nay, divers have gone so farre, as to make
Port-sale of Ship, Goods, and Person, so cunningly they have bene
shaven by these Barbers, and yet without any Razor.</p>

<p>It came to passe, and no long time since, that a young <i>Florentine</i>
of ours, named <i>Niccolo da Cignano</i>, but more usually called <i>Salabetto</i>,
imployed as Factor for his Maister, arrived at <i>Palermo</i>; his
Ship stored with many Woollen Cloathes, a remainder of such as
had bin sold at the Mart of <i>Salerno</i>, amounting in valew to above
five hundred Florines of Gold. When he had given in his packet
to the Custome-house, and made them up safe in his Ware-house;
without making shew of desiring any speedy dispatch, he delighted
to view all parts of the City, as mens minds are continuallie addicted
to Novelties. He being a very faire and affable young man, easie
to kindle affection in a very modest eie: it fortuned, that a Courtezane,
one of our before remembred shavers, who termed hir selfe
Madame <i>Biancafiore</i>, having heard somewhat concerning his affairs,
beganne to dart amorous glances at him. Which the indiscreete
youth perceyving, and thinking her to be some great Lady: began
also to grow halfe perswaded, that his comely person was pleasing
to her, and therefore he would carrie this good fortune of his somewhat
cautelously.</p>

<p>Without imparting his mind unto any one, he would daily passe
too and fro before her doore; which she observing, and having indifferently
wounded him with her wanton piercing lookes: she began
to use the first tricke of her Trade, by pretending her enflamed
affection towards him, which made her pine and consume away in
care, except he might be moved to pitty her. Whereupon, she sent
one of her <i>Pandoraes</i> unto him, perfectly instructed in the Art of a
<i>Maquerella</i>, who (after many cunning counterfetted sighes, and
teares, which she had alwayes ready at command) told him; that
his comely person and compleate perfections, had so wounded the
very soule of her Mistresse, as she could enjoy no rest in any place,
either by day or night. In regard whereof, she desired (above all
things else) to meete with him privately in a Bathe: with which
Wordes, she straightway tooke a Ring forth of her pursse, and in
most humble manner, delivered it unto him, as a token from her
Mistresse.</p>

<p><i>Salabetto</i> having heard this Message, was the onely joyfull man
that could be: and having receyved the Ring, looking on it advisedly;
first kissed it, and then put it upon his finger. Then in answer to
the Messenger, he sayd: That if her Mistresse <i>Biancafiore</i> affected
him, she sustained no losse thereby, in regard he loved her as fervently,
and was ready to be commanded by her, at any time whensoever
she pleased.</p>

<p>She having delivered this message to her Mistresse, was presently
returned backe againe to him, to let him understand, in which of
the Bathes she meant to meet him, on the next morrow in the evening.
This being counsell for himselfe onely to keepe, he imparted
it not to any friend whatsoever; but when the houre for their meeting
was come, he went unto the place where he was appointed, a
Bathe (belike) best agreeing with such businesse.</p>

<p>Not long had he taried there, but two Women slaves came laden
to him, the one bearing a Mattresse of fine Fustian on hir head,
and the other a great Basket filled with many things. Having spred
the Mattresse in a faire Chamber on a Couch-bed, they covered it
with delicate white Linnen sheets, all about embroidred with faire
Fringes of gold, then laid they on costly quilts of rich Silkes, artificially
wrought with gold and silver knots, having pearles and precious
stones interwoven among them, and two such rich pillowes,
as sildome before had the like bin seene. <i>Salabetto</i> putting off his
garments, entred the Bath prepared for him, where the two Slaves
washed his body very neatly. Soone after came <i>Biancafiore</i> hirselfe,
attended on by two other women slaves, and seeing <i>Salabetto</i> in the
Bathe; making him a lowly reverence, breathing forth infinite dissembled
sighes, and teares trickling downe her cheekes, kissing and
embracing him, thus she spake.</p>

<p>I know not what man else in the worlde, beside thy selfe, could
have the power to bring me hither: the fire flew from thy faire eies
(O thou incompareable lovely <i>Tuscane</i>) that melted my soule, and
makes me onely live at thy command. Then hurling off her light
wearing garment (because she came prepared for the purpose) shee
stept into the bathe to him, and, not permitting the Slaves a-while
to come neere, none but her selfe must now lave his body, with
Muske compounded Sope and Gilly-floures. Afterward, the slaves
washed both him and her, bringing two goodly sheetes, softe and
white, yeelding such a delicate smell of Roses, even as if they had
bene made of Rose-leaves. In the one, they folded <i>Salabetto</i>, and
her in the other, and so conveyed them on their shoulders unto the
prepared Bed-Couch, where because they should not sweate any
longer, they tooke the sheets from about them, and laid them gently
in the bed.</p>

<p>Then they opened the Basket, wherein were divers goodly Silver
bottles, some filled with Rosewaters, others with flowers of Orenges,
and Waters distilled of Gelsomine, Muske, and Amber-Greece,
wherewith (againe) the slaves bathed their bodyes in the
bed, &amp; afterward presented them with variety of Comfites, as also
very precious Wines, serving them in stead of a little Collation.
<i>Salabetto</i> supposed himself to be in Paradise: for this appeared to be
no earthly joy, bestowing a thousand gladsome gazes on her, who
(questionlesse) was a most beautifull creature, and the tarrying of
the Slaves, seemed millions of yeares to him, that hee might more
freely embrace his <i>Biancafiore</i>. Leaving a Waxe Taper lighted in
the Chamber, the slaves departed, and then shee sweetly embracing
<i>Salabetto</i>, bestowed those further favours on him, which hee
came for, and she was not squeamish in the affoording; whereof he
was exceedingly joyfull, because he imagined, that they proceeded
from the integrity of her affection towards him.</p>

<p>When she thought it convenient time to depart thence, the slaves
returned; they cloathed themselves, and had a Banquet standing
ready prepared for them; where-with they cheared their wearyed
spirits, after they had first washed in odorifferous waters. At parting:
<i>Salabetto</i> (quoth she) whensoever thy leysures shal best serve
thee, I will repute it as my cheefest happinesse, that thou wilt accept
a Supper and Lodging in my house, which let it be this instant
night, if thou canst. He being absolutely caught, both by hir beauty
and flattering behaviour: beleeved faithfully, that he was as intirely
beloved of her, as the heart is of the body: whereuppon hee
thus answered. Madame, whatsoever pleaseth you, must needes
be much more acceptable unto mee: and therefore, not onely
may command my service this night, but likewise the whole employment
of my life, to be onely yours in my very best studies and
endeavours.</p>

<p>No sooner did she heare this answer, but she returned home to
her owne house, which she decked in most sumptuous manner, and
also made ready a costly Supper, expecting the arrivall of <i>Salabetto</i>:
who when the darke night was indifferently well entred, went
thither, and was welcommed with wonderfull kindnesse, wanting
no costly Wines and Delicates all the Supper while. Being afterward
conducted into a goodly Chamber, he smelt there admirable
sweete senting savours, such as might well beseeme a Princes Pallace.
He beheld a most costly Bed, and very rich furniture round
about the roome: which when he had duly considered to himself,
he was constantly perswaded, that she was a Lady of infinite wealth.
And although he had heard divers flying reports concerning her
life, yet hee would not credite any thing amisse of her, for albeit
she might (perhappes) beguile some other; yet shee affected him
(he thought) in better manner, and no such misfortune could happen
to him.</p>

<p>Having spent all the night with her in wanton dalliances, &amp; being
risen in the morning; to enflame his affection more and more
towards her, and to prevent any ill opinion he might conceyve of
her, she bestowed a rich and costly Girdle on him, as also a pursse
most curiously wrought, saying to him. My sweet <i>Salabetto</i>, with
these testimonies of my true affection to thee, I give thee faithfully
to understand, that as my person is onely subjected thine; so this
house and all the riches in it, remaineth absolutely at thy disposition,
or whatsoever hereafter shal happen within the compasse of my
power.</p>

<p>He being not a little proud of this her bountifull offer (having
never bestowed any gift on her, because by no meanes shee would
admit it) after many sweet kisses and embraces; departed thence,
to the place where the Merchants usually frequented: resorting to
her (from time to time) as occasion served, and paying not one single
peny for all his wanton pleasure, by which cunning baytes (at
length) she caught him.</p>

<p>It came to passe, that having made sale of all his Clothes, whereby
hee had great gaines, and the moneyes justly payed him at the
times appointed: <i>Biancafiore</i> got intelligence thereof; yet not by
him, but from one of the Brokers. <i>Salabetto</i> comming one night to
sup with her, she embraced and kissed him as she was wont to doe,
and seemed so wonderfully addicted in love to him, even as if shee
would have dyed with delight in his armes. Instantly, shee would
needs bestow two goodly gilt standing Cuppes on him, which <i>Salabetto</i>
by no meanes would receive, because she had formerly bin
very bountifull to him, to above the value of an hundred Crowns,
and yet she would not take of him so much as a mite. At length,
pressing still more tokens of her love and bounty on him, which he
as courteously denied, as she kindly offered: one of her Women-slaves
(as shee had before cunningly appointed) sodainely calling
her, forthwith she departed out of her Chamber. And when she
had continued a pretty while absent, she returned againe weeping;
and throwing her selfe downe upon her Pallet, breathed forth such
sighes and wofull lamentations, as no Woman could possibly doe
the like.</p>

<p><i>Salabetto</i> amazedly wondering thereat, tooke her in his Armes,
and weeping also with her, said. Alas my deare Love, what sodain
accident hath befalne you, to urge this lamentable alteration? If you
love me, hide it not from me. After he had often entreated her in
this manner, casting her armes about his necke, and sighing as if her
heart would breake, thus she replyed.</p>

<p>Ah <i>Salabetto</i>, the onely Jewell of my joy on earth, I knowe not
what to do, or say, for (even now) I received Letters from <i>Messina</i>,
wherein my Brother writes to me, that although it cost the sale
of all my goods, or whatsoever else I have beside, I must (within
eight dayes space) not faile to send him a thousand Florins of gold,
or else he must have his head smitten off, and I know not by what
meanes to procure them so soone. For, if the limitation of fifteene
dayes might serve the turne; I could borrow them in a place, where
I can command a farre greater summe, or else I would sel some part
of our Lands. But beeing no way able to furnish him so soone, I
would I had died before I heard these dismall tydings. And in the
uttering of these words, she graced them with such cunning dissembled
sorrow, as if she had meant truly indeed.</p>

<p><i>Salabetto</i>, in whom the fury of his amorous flames, had consumed
a great part of his necessary understanding; beleeving these
counterfetted tears and complaints of hers, to proceed from an honest
meaning soule; rashly and foolishly thus replied. Deare <i>Biancafiore</i>,
I cannot furnish you with a thousand golden Florines, but am
able to lend you five hundred, if I were sure of their repayment at
fifteene dayes, wherein you are highly beholding to Fortune, that
I have made sale of all my Cloathes; which if they had lyen still on
my hand, my power could not stretch to lend you five Florines.
Alas deare heart (quoth she) would you be in such want of money,
and hide it from her that loves you so loyally? Why did you not
make your need knowne to me? Although I am not furnished of a
thousand Florines; yet I have alwaies ready three or foure hundred
by me, to do any kinde office for my friend. In thus wronging me,
you have robd me of all boldnes, to presume upon your offer made
me. <i>Salabetto</i>, far faster inveigled by these words then before, said.
Let not my folly (bright <i>Biancafiore</i>) cause you to refuse my friendly
offer, in such a case of extreme necessity: I have them ready prepared
for you, and am heartily sory, that my power cannot furnish
you with the whole summe.</p>

<p>Then catching him fast in her armes, thus she answered. Now I
plainly perceive, my dearest <i>Salabetto</i>, that the love thou bearest
me is true and perfect; when, without expectation of being requested,
thou art readie to succour me in such an urgent neede, &amp; with
so faire a summe of Florines. Sufficiently was I thine owne before,
but now am much more ingaged by so high deserving; with this
particular acknowledgement for ever, that my Brothers head was
redeemed by thy goodnesse onely. Heaven beareth me record, how
unwilling I am to be beholding in this kind, considring that you are
a Merchant, &amp; Merchants furnish al their affairs with ready monis:
but seeing necessity constraineth me, and I make no doubt of repaiment
at the time appointed: I shall the more boldly accept your
kindnes, with this absolute promise beside, that I wil rather sell all
the houses I have, then breake my honest word with you.</p>

<p>Counterfeit teares still drayning downe her cheeks, and <i>Salabetto</i>
kindly comforting her; he continued there with hir all that night,
to expresse himselfe her most liberall servant. And, without expecting
any more requesting, the next morning he brought her the
five hundred Florines, which she received with a laughing heart,
but outward dissembled weeping eies; <i>Salabetto</i> never demanding
any other security, but onely her single promise.</p>

<p><i>Biancafiore</i>, having thus received the five hundred Florines, the
indiction of the Almanacke began to alter: and whereas (before)
<i>Salabetto</i> could come see her whensoever he pleased, many occasions
now happened, whereby he came seven times for once, and yet
his entrance was scarsely admitted, neither was his entertainment
so affable, or his cheare so bountifull, as in his former accesses thither.
Moreover, when the time for repaiment was come, yea a moneth
or two over-past, and he demanded to have his money; hee
could have nothing but words for paiment. Now he began to consider
on the craft and cunning of this wicked Woman, as also his
owne shallow understanding, knowing he could make no proofe of
his debt, but what her selfe listed to say, having neither witnes, specialty,
bill or bond to shew: which made his folly so shamefull to
him, that he durst not complaine to any person, because he had received
some advertisements before, whereto he wold by no means
listen, and now should have no other amends, but publike infamie,
scorne and disgrace, which made him almost weary of his life, and
much to bemoane his owne unhappinesse. He received also divers
Letters from his Master, to make returne of the 500. Florines over
by way of banke, according as he had used to do: but nowe could
performe no such matter.</p>

<p>Hereupon, because his error should not be discovered, he departed
in a small vessell thence, not making for <i>Pisa</i>, as he should have
done, but directly for <i>Naples</i> hee shaped his course. At that instant
lodged there, <i>Don Pietro della Canigiano</i>, Treasurer of the Empresse
of <i>Constantinople</i>, a man of great wisedome and understanding, as
also very ingenious and politike, he being an especiall Favourer of
<i>Salabetto</i> and all his friendes, which made him presume the more
boldly (being urged thereto by meere necessity, the best corrector
of wandering wits) to acquaint him with his lamentable misfortune,
in every particular as it had hapned, requesting his aid and advice,
how he might best weare out the rest of his dayes, because hee
never meant to visit <i>Florence</i> any more.</p>

<p><i>Canigiano</i> being much displeased at the repetition of his Follie,
sharply reproved him, saying. Thou hast done leudly, in carying thy
selfe so loosely, and spending thy Masters goods so carelesly, which
though I cannot truly tearme spent, but rather art meerely cousened
and cheated of them, yet thou seest at what a deere rate thou
hast purchased pleasure, which yet is not utterly helplesse, but may
by one meanes or other be recovered. And being a man of woonderfull
apprehension, advised him instantly what was to bee done,
furnishing him also with a summe of money, wherewith to adventure
a second losse, in hope of recovering the first againe: he caused
divers Packes to be well bound up, with the Merchants markes orderly
made on them, and bought about twenty Buttes or Barrelles,
all filled (as it were) with Oyle, and these pretended commodities
being shipt, <i>Salabetto</i> returned with them to <i>Palermo</i>. Where having
given in his packets to the Custome-house, and entred them
all under his owne name, as being both owner and factor: all his
Wares were lockt up in his <i>Magizine</i>, with open publication, that
he would not vent any of them, before other merchandises (which
he daily expected) were there also arrived.</p>

<p><i>Biancafiore</i> having heard thereof, and understanding withall, that
he had brought Merchandises now with him, amounting to above
two thousand Florins, staying also in expectation of other commodities,
valewing better then three thousand more, she beganne to
consider with her selfe, that she had not yet gotten money enough
from him, and therefore would cast a figure for a farre bigger booty.
Which that she might the more fairely effect, without so much
as an imagination of the least mistrust: she would repay him backe
his five hundred Florines, to winne from him a larger portion of
two or three thousand at the least, and having thus setled her determination,
she sent to have him come speake with her. <i>Salabetto</i>,
having bene soundly bitten before, and therefore the better warranted
from the like ranckling teeth; willingly went to her, not shewing
any signe of former discontent: &amp; she, seeming as if she knew
nothing of the wealth he brought with him; gracing him in as loving
manner as ever she had done, thus she spake.</p>

<p>I am sure <i>Salabetto</i>, you are angry with mee, because I restored
not your Florines at my promised day. <i>Salabetto</i> smiling, presently
answered. Beleeve me Lady (quoth he) it did a little distast me,
even as I could have bin offended with him, that should plucke out
my heart to bestow it on you, if it would yeelde you any contentment.
But to let you know unfainedly, how much I am incensed
with anger against you: such and so great is the affection I beare
you, that I have solde the better part of my whole estate, converting
the same into Wealthy Merchandises, which I have alreadie
brought hither with mee, and valewing above two thousand Florines,
all which are stored up in in my <i>Magazine</i>. There must they remaine,
till another Ship come forth of the Western parts, wherein
I have a much greater adventure, amounting unto more then
three thousand Florines. And my purpose is, to make my aboade
heere in this City, which hath won the sole possession of my heart,
onely in regard of my <i>Biancafiore</i>, to whom I am so intirely devoted,
as both my selfe, and whatsoever else is mine (now or hereafter) is
dedicated onely to her service; whereto thus she replyed.</p>

<p>Now trust me <i>Salabetto</i>, whatsoever redoundeth to thy good
and benefite, is the cheefest comfort of my soule, in regard I prize
thy love dearer then mine owne life, and am most joyfull of thy returne
hither againe; but much more of thy still abiding heere, because
I intend to live onely with thee, so soone as I have taken order
for some businesse of import. In the meane while, let me entreate
thee to hold me excused, because before thy departure hence, thou
camest sometimes to see me, without thy entrance admitted; and
other-whiles againe, found not such friendly entertainement, as
formerly had bene affoorded. But indeede, and above all the rest,
in not re-paying thy money according to my promise. But consider
good <i>Salabetto</i>, in what great trouble and affliction of minde I
then was, both in regard of my Brothers danger, and other important
occurrences beside, which molestations do much distract the
senses, and hinder kinde courtesies, which otherwise would bee extended
liberally.</p>

<p>Last of all consider also, how difficult a thing it is for a woman,
so sodainly to raise the summe of a thousand golden Florines, when
one friend promiseth, and performeth not; another protesteth, yet
hath no such meaning; a third sweareth, and yet proveth a false Lyar:
so that by being thus ungently used, a breach is made betweene
the best friends living. From hence it proceeded, and no other defect
else, that I made not due returne of your five hundred Florins.
No sooner were you departed hence, but I had them readie, and as
many more, and could I have knowne whither to send them, they
had bene with you long time since, which because I could not (by
any meanes) compasse, I kept them still for you in continuall readinesse,
as hoping of your comming hither againe. So causing a purse
to be brought, wherein the same Florines were, which hee had delivered
her; she gave it into his hand, and prayed him to count them
over, whether there were so many, or no.</p>

<p>Never was <i>Salabettoes</i> heart halfe so joyfull before; and having
counted them, found them to be his owne five hundred Florines:
then, putting them up into his pocket, he saide. Comfort of my
life, Full well I know that whatsoever you have saide, is most certaine;
but let us talke no more of falshood in friendship, or casuall
accidents happening unexpected: you have dealt with mee like a
most loyall Mistresse, and heere I protest unfainedly to you, that as
well in respect of this kinde courtesie, as also the constancy of mine
affection to you, you cannot request hereafter a far greater summe
of me, to supply any necessarie occasion of yours; but (if my power
can performe it) you shall assuredly finde it certaine: make proofe
thereof whensoever you please, after my other goods are Landed,
and I have established my estate here in your City.</p>

<p>Having in this manner renewed his wonted amity with her, and
with words farre enough off from all further meaning: <i>Salabetto</i>
began againe to frequent her company, she expressing all former familiarity,
and shewing her selfe as lavishly bountifull to him, in all
respects as before she had done, nay, many times in more magnificent
manner.</p>

<p>But he intending to punish her notorious trechery towards him,
when she left him as an open scorne to the World, wounded with
disgrace, and quite out of credit with all his friends: she having (on
a day) solemnly invited him, to suppe and lodge in her house all
night; he went, both with sad and melancholly lookes, seeming as
overcome with extreamity of sorrow. <i>Biancafiore</i> mervayling at
this strange alteration in him, sweetly kissing and embracing him:
would needs know the reason of his passionate affliction, &amp; he permitting
her to urge the question oftentimes together, without returning
any direct answere; to quit her in her kind, and with coine
of her owne stampe, after a few dissembled sighes, he began in this
manner.</p>

<p>Ah my dearest Love, I am utterly undone, because the Shippe
containing the rest of mine expected Merchandises, is taken by the
Pyrates of <i>Monago</i>, and put to the ransome of tenne thousand Florines
of Gold, and my part particularly, is to pay one thousand. At
this instant I am utterly destitute of money, because the five hundred
Florines which I received of you, I sent hence the next daie
day following to <i>Naples</i>, to buy more cloathes, which likewise are
to be sent hither. And if I should now make sale of the Merchandizes
in my Magazine (the time of generall utterance being not yet
come) I shall not make a pennyworth for a penny. And my misfortune
is the greater, because I am not so well knowne heere in your
City, as to find some succour in such an important distresse; wherefore
I know not what to do or say. Moreover, if the money be not
speedily sent, our goods will be carried into <i>Monago</i>, and then they
are past all redemption utterly.</p>

<p><i>Biancafiore</i> appearing greatly discontented, as one verily perswaded,
that this pretended losse was rather hers, then his, because she
aymed at the mainest part of all his wealth: began to consider with
her selfe, which was the likeliest course to be taken, for saving the
goods from carriage to <i>Monago</i>: whereupon thus she replied. Heaven
knoweth (my dearest <i>Salabetto</i>) how thy love maketh me sorrowfull
for this misfortune, and it greeveth me to see thee any way
distressed: for if I had mony lying by mee (as many times I have)
thou shouldst finde succour from my selfe onely, but indeede I am
not able to helpe thee. True it is, there is a friend of mine, who did
lend me five hundred Florines in my need, to make uppe the other
summe which I borrowed of thee: but he demandeth extreme interest,
because he will not abate any thing of thirty in the hundred,
and if you should bee forced to use him, you must give him some
good security. Now for my part, the most of my goods here I will
pawne for thee: but what pledge can you deliver in to make up the
rest? Wel did <i>Salabetto</i> conceive, the occasion why she urged this
motion, and was so diligent in doing him such a pleasure: for it appeared
evidently to him, that herselfe was to lend the mony, whereof
he was not a little joyful, seeming very thankful to hir. Then he told
her, that being driven to such extremity, how unreasonable soever
the usury was, yet he would gladly pay for it. And for her Friends
further security, hee would pawne him all the goods in his <i>Magazine</i>,
entering them downe in the name of the party, who lent the
money. Onely he desired to keepe the Keyes of the Ware-house,
as well to shew his Merchandises, when any Merchant should bee
so desirous: as also to preserve them from ill using, transporting or
changing, before his redemption of them.</p>

<p>She found no fault with his honest offer, but sayde, hee shewed
himselfe a well-meaning man, and the next morning shee sent for a
Broker, in whom she reposed especiall trust; and after they had privately
consulted together, shee delivered him a thousand Golden
Florines, which were caried by him presently to <i>Salabetto</i>, and the
Bond made in the Brokers name, of all the goods remaining in <i>Salabettoes</i>
ware-house, with composition and absolute agreement, for
the prefixed time of the monies repaiment. No sooner was this
tricke fully accomplished, but <i>Salabetto</i> seeming as if he went to redeeme
his taken goods: set saile for <i>Naples</i> towards <i>Pietro della Canigiano</i>,
with fifteene hundred Florines of Gold: from whence also
he sent contentment to his Master at <i>Florence</i> (who imployd him
as his Factor at <i>Palermo</i>) beside his owne packes of Cloathes. He
made repayment likewise to <i>Canigiano</i>, for the monies which furnished
him in this last voyage, and any other to whom hee was indebted.
So there he stayed awhile with <i>Canigiano</i>, whose counsel
thus holpe him to out-reach the <i>Sicillian</i> Courtezane: and meaning
to deale in Merchandise no more, afterward he returned to <i>Florence</i>
and there lived in good reputation.</p>

<p>Now as concerning <i>Biancafiore</i>, when she saw that <i>Salabetto</i> returned
not againe to <i>Palermo</i>, she beganne to grow somewhat abashed,
as halfe suspecting that which followed. After she had tarried
for him above two moneths space, and perceived hee came not,
nor any tydings heard of him: shee caused the Broker to breake open
the Magazine, casting forth the Buttes or Barrels, which shee
beleeved to bee full of good Oyles. But they were all filled with
Sea-Water, each of them having a small quantity of Oyle floating
on the toppe, onely to serve when a tryall should bee made. And
then unbinding the Packes, made up in formall and Merchantable
manner: there was nothing else in them, but Logges and stumpes
of Trees; wrapt handsomely in hurdles of Hempe and Tow; onely
two had Cloathes in them. So that (to bee briefe) the whole did
not value two hundred Crownes: which when she saw, and observed
how cunningly she was deceived: a long while after shee sorrowed,
for repaying backe the five hundred Florines, and folly in
lending a thousand more, using it as a Proverbe alwaies after to hir
selfe: <i>That whosoever dealt with a Tuscane, had neede to have found
sight and judgement.</i> So remaining contented (whither she would
or no) with her losse: she plainly perceyved, that although she lived
by cheating others, yet now at the length she had mette with
her match.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So soone as <i>Dioneus</i> had ended his Novell, Madame <i>Lauretta</i>
also knew, that the conclusion of her Regiment was
come; whereupon, when the counsell of <i>Canigiano</i> had
past with generall commendation, and the wit of <i>Salabetto</i> no lesse
applauded, for fitting it with such an effectuall prosecution; shee
tooke the Crowne of Laurell from her owne head, and set it upon
Madame <i>Æmilliaes</i>, speaking graciously in this manner. Madam,
I am not able to say, how pleasant a Queene we shall have of you,
but sure I am, that we shall enjoy a faire one: let matters therefore
be so honourably carried; that your government may be answerable
to your beautifull perfections; which words were no sooner delivered,
but she sate downe in her mounted seate.</p>

<p>Madame <i>Æmillia</i> being somewhat bashfull, not so much of hir
being created Queene, as to heare her selfe thus publikely praysed,
with that which Women do most of all desire: her face then appearing,
like the opening of the Damaske Rose, in the goodlyest
morning. But after she had a while dejected her lookes, and the
Vermillion blush was vanished away: having taken order with the
Master of the houshold, for all needfull occasions befitting the assembly,
thus she began.</p>

<p>Gracious Ladies, wee behold it daily, that those Oxen which
have laboured in the yoake most part of the day, for their more
convenient feeding, are let forth at liberty, and permitted to wander
abroad in the Woods. We see moreover, that Gardens and
Orchards, being planted with variety of the fairest fruit Trees, are
equalled in beauty by Woods and Forrests, in the plentifull enjoying
of as goodly spreading branches. In consideration whereof, remembring
how many dayes wee have already spent (under the severitie
of Lawes imposed) shaping all our discourses to a forme of
observation: I am of opinion, that it will not onely well become
us, but also prove beneficiall for us, to live no longer under such restraint,
and like enthralled people, desirous of liberty, wee should
no more be subjected to the yoke, but recover our former strength
in walking freely.</p>

<p>Wherefore, concerning our pastime purposed for to morrow, I
am not minded to use any restriction, or tye you unto any particular
ordination: but rather do liberally graunt, that every one shall
devise and speake of arguments agreeing with your owne dispositions.</p>

<p>Besides, I am verily perswaded, that variety of matter uttered so
freely, will be much more delightfull, then restraint to one kinde of
purpose onely. Which being thus granted by me, whosoever shal
succeede me in the government may (as being of more power and
preheminence) restraine all backe againe to the accustomed lawes.
And having thus spoken, she dispensed with their any longer attendance,
untill it should be Supper time.</p>

<p>Every one commended the Queenes appointment, allowing it to
rellish of good wit and judgement; and being all risen, fell to such
exercises as they pleased. The Ladies made Nosegaies and Chaplets
of Flowers, the men played on their Instruments, singing divers
sweete Ditties to them, and thus were busied untill Supper
time. Which beeing come, and they supping about the beautifull
Fountains: after Supper, they fell to singing and dauncing. In the
end, the Queene, to imitate the order of her predecessors, commanded
<i>Pamphilus</i>, that notwithstanding all the excellent songs formerly
sung: he should now sing one, whereunto dutifully obeying,
thus he began.</p>

<p>Thus the Song of <i>Pamphilus</i> ended, whereto all the rest (as a
Chorus) answered with their Voyces, yet every one particularly
(according as they felt their Love-sicke passions) made a curious
construction thereof, perhaps more then they needed, yet not Divining
what <i>Pamphilus</i> intended. And although they were transported
with variety of imaginations; yet none of them could arrive
at his true meaning indeed. Wherefore the Queene, perceiving the
Song to be fully ended, and the Ladies, as also the young Gentlemen,
willing to go take their rest: she commaunded them severally
to their Chambers.</p>


<h4><i>The End of the Eight Day.</i></h4>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="THE_NINTH_DAY" id="THE_NINTH_DAY">THE
NINTH
DAY.</a></h2>


<h4><i>Whereon, under the Government of Madame</i>
<span class="smcap">Æmillia,</span> <i>the Argument of each severall
Discourse, is not limitted to any one peculiar
subject: but every one remaineth at liberty,
to speak of whatsoever themselves best pleaseth.</i></h4>


<h4>The Induction.</h4>


<p>Faire <i>Aurora</i>, from whose bright
and chearefull lookes, the duskie
darke night flyeth as an utter enemy,
had already reached so high as
the eight Heaven, converting it
all into an Azure colour, and the
pretty Flowrets beganne to spred
open their Leaves: when Madame <i>Æmillia</i>, beeing
risen, caused all her female attendants, and the young
Gentlemen likewise, to be summoned for their personall
appearance. Who being all come, the Queen
leading the way, and they following her Majesticke
pace, walked into a little Wood, not farre off distant
from the Palace.</p>

<p>No sooner were they there arrived, but they beheld
store of Wilde Beasts, as Hindes, Hares, Goats,
and such like; so safely secured from the pursuite of
Huntsmen (by reason of the violent Pestilence then
reigning) that they stood gazing boldly at them, as
dreadlesse of any danger, or as if they were become
tame and Domesticke.</p>

<p>Approaching neerer them, first to one, then unto
another, as if they purposed to play gently with
them, they then beganne to skippe and runne, making
them such pastime with their pretty tripping,
that they conceyved great delight in beholding of
them.</p>

<p>But when they beheld the Sunne to exalt itselfe, it
was thought convenient to return back again, shrouding
themselves under the Trees spreading armes,
their hands full of sweete Flowers and Odorifferous
Hearbes, which they had gathered in their Walking.
So that such as chanced to meete them, could say nothing
else: but that death knew not by what meanes
to conquer them, or els they had set down an absolute
determination, to kill him with their Joviall disposition.</p>

<p>In this manner, singing, dancing, or prettily pratling,
at length they arrived at the Palace, where they
found all things readily prepared, and their Servants
duly attending for them. After they hadde reposed
themselves awhile, they would not (as yet) sit downe
at the Table, untill they had sung halfe a dozen of
Canzonets, some more pleasant then another, both
the women and men together.</p>

<p>Then they fell to washing hands, and the Maister
of the Houshold caused them to sit downe, according
as the Queene had appointed, and Dinner was most
sumptuously served in before them. Afterward, when
the Tables were with-drawne, they all tooke handes
to dance a Roundelay; which being done, they plaied
on their Instruments a while; and then, such as so
pleased, tooke their rest. But when the accustomed
houre was come, they all repaired to the place of discoursing,
where the Queen, looking on Madam <i>Philomena</i>,
gave her the honour of beginning the first Novell
for that day: whereto shee dutifully condiscending,
began as followeth.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a name="Madam_Francesca_a_Widdow_of_Pistoya_being_affected_by_two_Florentine" id="Madam_Francesca_a_Widdow_of_Pistoya_being_affected_by_two_Florentine"><i>Madam</i> Francesca, <i>a Widdow of</i> Pistoya, <i>being affected by two</i> Florentine
<i>Gentlemen, the one named</i> Rinuccio Palermini, <i>and the other</i>
Alessandro Chiarmontesi, <i>and she bearing no good will to eyther
of them; ingeniously freed her selfe from both their importunate
suites. One of them she caused to lye as dead in a grave, and the
other to fetch him from thence: so neither of them accomplishing
what they were enjoyned, fayled of obtaining his hoped expectation.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The First Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Approving, that chaste and honest Women, ought rather to deny importunate
suiters, by subtile and ingenious meanes, then fall into the
danger of scandall and slander.</i></h4>


<p>Madame, it can no way discontent mee (seeing
it is your most gracious pleasure) that I
should have the honour, to breake the first
staffe of freedome in this faire company (according
to the injunction of your Majesty)
for liberty of our own best liking arguments:
wherein I dismay not (if I can speake well enough)
but to please you all as well, as any
other that is to follow me. Nor am I so oblivious (worthy Ladies)
but full well I remember, that many times hath bene related in our
passed demonstrations, how mighty and variable the powers of
love are: and yet I cannot be perswaded, that they have all bene so
sufficiently spoken of, but something may bee further added, and
the bottome of them never dived into, although we should sit arguing
a whole yeare together. And because it hath beene alreadie
approved, that Lovers have bene led into divers accidents, not onely
inevitable dangers of death, but also have entred into the verie
houses of the dead, thence to convey their amorous friends: I purpose
to acquaint you with a Novell, beside them which have bene
discoursed; whereby you may not onely comprehend the power
of Love, but also the wisedome used by an honest Gentlewoman,
to rid her selfe of two importunate suiters, who loved her against
her owne liking, yet neither of them knowing the others affection.</p>

<p>In the City of <i>Pistoya</i>, there dwelt sometime a beautifull Gentlewoman,
being a Widdow, whom two of our <i>Florentines</i> (the one
named <i>Rinuccio Palermini</i>, and the other <i>Alessandro Chiarmontesi</i>),
having withdrawne themselves to <i>Pistoya</i> desperately affected, the
one ignorant of the others intention, but each carrying his case
closely, as hoping to be possessed of her. This Gentlewoman, named
Madame <i>Francesca de Lazzari</i>, being often solicited by their
messages, and troublesomely pestered with their importunities: at
last (lesse advisedly then she intended) shee granted admittance to
heare either of them speake. Which she repenting, and coveting to
be rid of them both, a matter not easie to be done: she wittily devised
the onely meanes, namely, to move such a motion to them, as
neither would willingly undertake, yet within the compasse of possibility;
but they failing in the performance, shee might have the
more honest occasion, to bee free from all further molestation by
them, and her politike intention was thus projected.</p>

<p>On the same day, when she devised this peece of service, a man
was buried in <i>Pistoya</i>, and in the Church-yard belonging unto the
gray Friars, who being descended of good and worthie parentage:
yet himselfe was very infamous, and reputed to be the vilest man living,
not onely there in <i>Pistoya</i>, but throughout the whole World
beside. Moreover, while he lived, he had such a strange misshapen
body, and his face so ugly deformed, that such as knew him not,
would stand gastly affrighted at the first sight of him. In regarde
whereof, shee considered with her selfe, that the foule deformitie
of this loathed fellow, would greatly avayle in her determination,
and consulting with her Chamber-maid, thus she spake.</p>

<p>Thou knowest (my most true and faithfull servant) what trouble
and affliction of minde I suffer dayly, by the messages and
Letters of the two <i>Florentines, Rinuccio</i> and <i>Alessandro,</i> how hatefull
their importunity is to me, as being utterly unwilling to hear them
speake, or yeeld to any thing which they desire. Wherefore, to
free my selfe from them both together, I have devised (in regard of
their great and liberall offers) to make trial of them in such a matter,
as I am assured they will never performe.</p>

<p>It is not unknowne to thee, that in the Church-yard of the Gray
Friars, and this instant morning, <i>Scannadio</i> (for so was the ugly
fellow named) was buried; of whom, when he was living, as also
now being dead, both men, women, and children, doe yet stand in
feare, so gastly and dreadfull alwayes was his personall appearance
to them. Wherefore, first of all go thou to <i>Alessandro</i>, and say to
him thus. My Mistris <i>Francesca</i> hath sent me to you, to tell you,
that now the time is come, wherein you may deserve to enjoy her
love, and gaine the possession of her person, if you will accomplish
such a motion as she maketh to you. For some especiall occasion,
wherewith hereafter you shall bee better acquainted, a neere Kinsman
of hers, must needs have the body of <i>Scannadio</i> (who was buried
this morning) brought to her house. And she, being as much
affraid of him now he is dead, as when he was living, by no meanes
would have his body brought thither.</p>

<p>In which respect, as a Token of your unfeigned love to her, and
the latest service you shall ever do for her: shee earnestly entreateth
you, that this night, in the very deadest time thereof, you would go
to the grave, where <i>Scannadio</i> lyeth yet uncovered with earth untill
to morrow, and attyring your selfe in his garments, even as if you
were the man himselfe, so to remaine there untill her kinsman doe
come.</p>

<p>Then, without speaking any one word, let him take you foorth
of the grave, &amp; bring you thence (insted of <i>Scannadio</i>) to hir house:
where she will give you gentle welcome, and disappoint her Kinsman
in his hope, by making you Lord of her, and all that is hers,
as afterward shall plainly appeare. If he say he wil do it, it is as much
as I desire: but if hee trifle and make deniall, then boldly tell him,
that he must refraine all places wheresoever I am, and forbeare to
send me any more Letters, or messages.</p>

<p>Having done so, then repaire to <i>Rinuccio Palermini</i>, and say. My
Mistresse <i>Francesca</i> is ready to make acceptance of your love; provided,
that you will do one thing for her sake. Namely, this ensuing
night, in the midst &amp; stillest season thereof, to go to the grave where
<i>Scannadio</i> was this morning buried, &amp; (without making any noise)
or speaking one word, whatsoever you shall heare or see: to take
him forth of the grave, and bring him home to her house, where you
shal know the reason of this strange businesse, and enjoy her freely
as your owne for ever. But if he refuse to do it, then I commaund
him, never hereafter to see me, or move further suite unto mee, by
any meanes whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Chamber-maide went to them both, and delivered the severall
messages from her Mistresse, according as she had given her
in charge; whereunto each of them answered, that they woulde
(for her sake) not onely descend into a Grave, but also into hell, if
it were her pleasure.</p>

<p>She returning with this answer unto her Mistresse, <i>Francesca</i> remained
in expectation, what the issue of these fond attemptes in
them, would sort unto. When night was come, and the middle
houre thereof already past, <i>Alessandro Chiarmontesi</i>, having put off
all other garments to his doublet and hose, departed secretly from
his lodging, walking towards the Church-yard, where <i>Scannadio</i>
lay in his grave: but by the way as he went, hee became surprized
with divers dreadfull conceites and imaginations, and questioned
with himselfe thus.</p>

<p>What a beast am I? What a businesse have I undertaken? And
whither am I going? What do I know, but that the Kinsman unto
this Woman, perhappes understanding mine affection to her, and
crediting some such matter, as is nothing so; hath laide this politicke
traine for me, that he may murther me in the grave? Which
(if it should so happen) my life is lost, and yet the occasion never
knowne whereby it was done. Or what know I, whether some secret
enemy of mine (affecting her in like manner, as I do) have devised
this stratagem (out of malice) against mee, to draw my life in
danger, and further his owne good Fortune? Then, contrary motions,
overswaying these suspitions, he questioned his thoughts in
another nature.</p>

<p>Let me (quoth he) admit the case, that none of these surmises are
intended, but her Kinsman (by and in this manner devised) must
bring me into her house: I am not therefore perswaded, that he or
they do covet, to have the body of <i>Scannadio</i>, either to carry it thither,
or present it to her, but rather do aime at some other end. May
not I conjecture, that my close murthering is purposed, and this
way acted, as on him that (in his life time) had offended them? The
Maid hath straitly charged me, that whatsoever is said or done unto
me, I am not to speake a word. What if they pull out mine eies,
teare out my teeth, cut off my hands, or do me any other mischiefe:
Where am I then? Shall all these extremities barre me of speaking?
On the other side, if I speake, then I shall be knowne, and so much
the sooner (perhaps) be abused. But admit that I sustaine no injurie
at all, as being guilty of no transgression: yet (perchance) I shall
not be carried to her house, but to some other baser place, and afterward
she shall reprove me, that I did not accomplish what shee
commanded, and so all my labour is utterly lost.</p>

<p>Perplexed with these various contradicting opinions, he was willing
divers times to turne home backe againe: yet such was the violence
of his love, and the power thereof prevailing against all sinister
arguments; as he went to the grave, and removing the boordes
covering it, whereinto he entred; and having despoiled <i>Scannadio</i>
of his garments, cloathed himselfe with them, &amp; so laid him down,
having first covered the grave againe. Not long had hee tarryed
there, but he began to bethinke him, what manner of man <i>Scannadio</i>
was, and what strange reports had bene noised of him, not onely
for ransicking dead mens graves in the night season, but many other
abhominable Villanies committed by him, which so fearfully
assaulted him; that his haire stoode on end, every member of him
quaked, and every minute he imagined <i>Scannadio</i> rising, with intent
to strangle him in the grave. But his fervent affection overcoming
all these idle feares, and lying stone still, as if he had beene the
dead man indeede; he remained to see the end of his hope.</p>

<p>On the contrary side, after midnight was past, <i>Rinuccio Palermini</i>
departed from his lodging, to do what hee was enjoyned by his
hearts Mistresse, and as hee went along, divers considerations also
ran in his minde, concerning occasions possible to happen. As, falling
into the hands of Justice, with the body of <i>Scannadio</i> upon his
backe, and being condemned for sacriledge, in robbing graves of
the dead; either to be burned, or otherwise so punished, as might
make him hatefull to his best friends, and meerely a shame to himselfe.</p>

<p>Many other the like conceits molested him, sufficient to alter his
former determination: but affection was much more prevayling in
him, and made him use this consultation. How now <i>Rinuccio</i>? Wilt
thou dare to deny the first request, being mooved to thee by a Gentlewoman,
whom thou dearly lovest, and is the onely meanes,
whereby to gaine assurance of her gracious favour? Undoubtedly,
were I sure to die in the attempt, yet I will accomplish my promise.
And so he went on with courage to the grave.</p>

<p><i>Alessandro</i> hearing his arrivall, and also the removall of the bords,
although he was exceedingly affraid; yet he lay quietly stil, and stirred
not, and <i>Rinuccio</i> beeing in the grave, tooke <i>Alessandro</i> by the
feete, haling him forth, and (mounting him uppon his backe) went
on thus loden, towards the house of Madam <i>Francesca</i>. As he passed
along the streets, unseene or unmet by any, <i>Alessandro</i> suffered many
shrewd rushings and punches, by turnings at the streets corners,
and jolting against bulkes, poasts, and stalles, which <i>Rinuccio</i> could
not avoyd, in regard the night was so wonderfully darke, as hee
could not see which way he went.</p>

<p>Being come somewhat neere to the Gentlewomans house, and
she standing readie in the Window with her Maide, to see when
<i>Rinuccio</i> should arrive there with <i>Alessandro</i>, provided also of an
apt excuse, to send them thence like a couple of Coxcombes; it fortuned,
that the Watchmen, attending there in the same streete, for
the apprehension of a banished man, stolne into the City contrarie
to order; hearing the trampling of <i>Rinuccioes</i> feete, directed their
course as they heard the noise, having their Lanthorne and light
closely covered, to see who it should be, and what he intended, and
beating their weapons against the ground, demanded, Who goes
there? <i>Rinuccio</i> knowing their voyces, and that now was no time
for any long deliberation: let fall <i>Alessandro</i>, and ran away as fast
as his legs could carry him.</p>

<p><i>Alessandro</i> being risen againe (although he was cloathed in <i>Scannadioes</i>
Garments, which were long and too bigge for him) fledde
away also as <i>Rinuccio</i> did. All which Madame <i>Francesca</i> easily discerned
by helpe of the Watchmens Lanthorne, and how <i>Rinuccio</i>
carried <i>Alessandro</i> on his backe, beeing attired in the Garments of
<i>Scannadio</i>: whereat she mervailed not a little, as also the great boldnesse
of them both. But in the midst of her mervailing, she laughed
very heartily, when she saw the one let the other fall, and both to
runne away so manfully. Which accident pleasing her beyond all
comparison, and applauding her good Fortune, to bee so happily
delivered from their daily molestation: she betooke herselfe to hir
Chamber with the Maide, avouching solemnly to her, that (questionlesse)
they both affected her dearely, having undertaken such a
straunge imposition, and verie neere brought it to a finall conclusion.</p>

<p><i>Rinuccio</i>, being sadly discontented, and cursing his hard fortune,
would not yet returne home to his Lodging: but, when the watch
was gone forth of that streete, came backe to the place where he let
fall <i>Alessandro</i>, purposing to accomplish the rest of his enterprize.
But not finding the body, and remaining fully perswaded, that the
Watchmen were possessed thereof; hee went away, greeving extreamly.
And <i>Alessandro</i>, not knowing now what should become
of him: confounded with the like griefe and sorrow, that all his
hope was thus utterly overthrowne, retired thence unto his owne
house, not knowing who was the Porter which carried him.</p>

<p>The next morning, the grave of <i>Scannadio</i> being found open,
&amp; the body not in it, because <i>Alessandro</i> had thrown it into a deep
ditch neere adjoyning: all the people of <i>Pistoya</i> were possessed with
sundry opinions, some of the more foolish sort verily beleeving,
that the divell had caried away the dead body. Neverthelesse, each
of the Lovers, severally made knowne to Madam <i>Francesca</i>, what
he had done, and how disappointed, either excusing himselfe, that
though her command had not bin fully accomplished, yet to continue
her favour towards him. But she, like a wise and discreet Gentlewoman,
seeming not to credit either the one or other: discharged
her selfe honestly of them both, with a cutting answere, That shee
would never (afterward) expect any other service from them, because
they had fayled in their first injunction.</p>

<i>arising hastily in the night time without a Candle, to take
one of her Daughter Nunnes in bed with a young Gentleman, whereof
she was enviously accused, by certaine of her other Sisters: The
Abbesse her selfe (being at the same time in bed with a Priest) imagining
to have put on her head her plaited vayle, put on the Priests
breeches. Which when the poore Nunne perceyved; by causing the
Abbesse to see her owne error, she got her selfe to be absolved, and had
the freer liberty afterward, to be more familiar with her friend, then
formerly she had bin.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Second Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Whereby is declared, that whosoever is desirous to reprehend sinne in
other men, should first examine himselfe, that he be not guiltie of
the same crime.</i></h4>


<p>By this time, Madame <i>Philomena</i> sate silent, and the wit of
<i>Francesca</i>, in freeing her selfe from them whom she could
not fancie, was generally commended: as also on the contrary,
the bold presumption of the two amorous suiters, was reputed
not to be love, but meerely folly. And then the Queene, with
a gracious admonition, gave way for Madam Eliza to follow next;
who presently thus began.</p>

<p>Worthy Ladies, Madame <i>Francesca</i> delivered her selfe discreetly
from trouble, as already hath bin related: but a young Nun, by
the helpe and favour of Fortune, did also free her selfe (in speaking
advisedly) from an inconvenience sodainly falling on her. And as
you well know, there wants none of them, who (like bold Bayards)
will be very forward in checking other mens misdemeanours, when
themselves, as my Novell will approve, deserve more justly to bee
corrected. As hapned to a Lady Abbesse, under whose governement
the same young Nunne was, of whom I am now to speake.</p>

<p>You are then to understand (Gracious Auditors) that in <i>Lombardie</i>
there was a goodly Monastery, very famous for Holinesse and
Religion, where, among other sanctified Sisters, there was a young
Gentlewoman, endued with very singular beautie, being named <i>Isabella</i>,
who on a day, when a Kinsman of hers came to see her at
the grate, became enamored of a young Gentleman, being then in
his company.</p>

<p>He likewise, beholding her to be so admirably beautifull, &amp; conceyving
by the pretty glances of her eye, that they appeared to bee
silent intelligencers of the hearts meaning, grew also as affectionately
inclined towards her, and this mutuall love continued thus
concealed a long while, but not without great affliction unto them
both. In the end, either of them being circumspect and provident
enough, the Gentleman contrived a meanes, whereby he might secretly
visite his Nunne, wherewith she seemed no way discontented:
and this visitation was not for once or twice, but verie often,
and closely concealed to themselves.</p>

<p>At length it came to passe, that either through their owne indiscreete
carriage, or jelous suspition in some others: it was espied by
one of the Sisters, both the Gentlemans comming and departing,
yet unknowne to him or <i>Isabella</i>. The saide Sister, disclosing the
same to two or three more: they agreed together, to reveale it to
the Lady Abbesse, who was named Madame <i>Usimbalda</i>, a holy and
devout Lady, in common opinion of all the Nunnes, and whosoever
else knew her.</p>

<p>They further concluded (because <i>Isabella</i> should not deny theyr
accusation) to contrive the businesse so cunningly: that the Ladie
Abbesse should come her selfe in person, and take the young Gentleman
in bed with the Nun. And uppon this determination, they agreed
to watch nightly by turnes, because by no meanes they wold
be prevented: so to surprise poore <i>Isabella</i>, who beeing ignorant of
their treachery, suspected nothing. Presuming thus still on this secret
felicitie, and fearing no disaster to befall her: it chaunced (on a
night) that the young Gentleman being entred into the Nuns Dorter,
the Scowts had descried him, &amp; intended to be revenged on her.</p>

<p>After some part of the night was overpast, they divided themselves
into two bands, one to guard <i>Isabellaes</i> Dorter doore, the other
to carry newes to the Abbesse, and knocking at her Closet
doore, saide. Rise quickely Madame, and use all the hast you may,
for we have seene a man enter our Sister <i>Isabellaes</i> Dorter, and you
may take her in bed with him. The Lady Abbesse, who (the very
same night) had the company of a lusty Priest in bed with her selfe,
as oftentimes before she had, and he being alwayes brought thither
in a Chest: hearing these tidings, and fearing also, lest the Nunnes
hastie knocking at her doore, might cause it to fly open, and so (by
their entrance) have her owne shame discovered: arose very hastily,
and thinking she had put on her plaited vaile, which alwayes she
walked with in the night season, and used to tearme her Psalter; she
put the Priests breeches upon her head, and so went away in all
hast with them, supposing them verily to be her Psalter: but making
fast the Closet doore with her keye, because the Priest should not
be discovered.</p>

<p>Away shee went in all haste with the Sisters, who were so
forward in the detection of poore <i>Isabella</i>, as they never regarded
what manner of vaile the Lady Abbesse wore on her head. And
being come to the Dorter doore, quickly they lifted it off from the
hookes, and being entred, found the two Lovers sweetly imbracing:
but yet so amazed at this sudden surprisall, as they durst not
stirre, nor speake one word. The young Nunne <i>Isabella</i>, was raised
forthwith by the other Sisters, and according as the Abbesse had
commaunded, was brought by them into the Chapter-house: the young
Gentleman remaining still in the Chamber, where he put on his
garments, awaiting to see the issue of this businesse, and verily intending
to act severe revenge on his betrayers, if any harme were done
to <i>Isabella</i>, and afterward to take her thence away with him, as
meaning to make her amends by marriage.</p>

<p>The Abbesse being seated in the Chapter house, and all the other
Nunnes then called before her, who minded nothing else but the
poore offending Sister: she began to give her very harsh and vile
speeches, as never any transgressor suffered the like, and as to her
who had (if it should be openly knowne abroad) contaminated by
her lewde life and actions, the sanctity and good renowne of the
whole Monastery, and threatned her with very severe chastisement.
Poore <i>Isabella</i>, confounded with feare and shame, as being no way
able to excuse her fault, knew not what answer to make, but standing
silent, made her case compassionable to all the rest, even those
hard-hearted Sisters which betrayed her.</p>

<p>And the Abbesse still continuing her harsh speeches, it fortuned,
that <i>Isabella</i>, raising her head, which before she dejected into hir bosome,
espied the breeches on her head, with the stockings hanging
on either side of her; the sight whereof did so much encourage her,
that boldly she said. Madam, let a poore offender advise you for to
mend your veile, and afterward say to me what you will.</p>

<p>The Abbesse being very angry; and not understanding what she
meant, frowningly answered. Why how now saucy companion?
What vaile are you prating of? Are you so malapert, to bee chatting
already? Is the deed you have done, to be answered in such immodest
manner? <i>Isabella</i> not a jot danted by her sterne behaviour,
once againe said. Good Madam let me perswade you to sette your
vaile right, and then chide me as long as you will. At these words,
all the rest of the Nunnes exalted their lookes, to behold what vaile
the Abbesse wore on her head, wherewith <i>Isabella</i> should finde such
fault, and she her selfe lift up her hand to feele it: and then they all
perceyved plainly, the reason of <i>Isabellas</i> speeches, and the Abbesse
saw her owne error.</p>

<p>Hereupon, when the rest observed, that she had no help to cloud
this palpable shame withall, the tide began to turne, and hir tongue
found another manner of Language, then her former fury to poore
<i>Isabella</i>, growing to this conclusion, that it is impossible to resist against
the temptations of the flesh. And therefore she saide: Let all
of you take occasion, according as it offereth it selfe, as both we and
our predecessors have done: to be provident for your selves, take
time while you may, having this sentence alwaies in remembrance,
<i>Si non caste, tamen caute</i>.</p>

<p>So, having granted the young Nunne <i>Isabella</i> free absolution: the
Lady Abbesse returned backe againe to bed to the Priest, and <i>Isabella</i>
to the Gentleman. As for the other Sisters, who (as yet) were
without the benefit of friends; they intended to provide themselves
so soone as they could, being enduced thereto by so good example.</p>

<h4><a name="Master_Simon_the_Physitian_by_the_perswasions_of_Bruno_Buffalmaco" id="Master_Simon_the_Physitian_by_the_perswasions_of_Bruno_Buffalmaco"><i>Master</i> Simon <i>the Physitian, by the perswasions of</i> Bruno, Buffalmaco,
<i>and a third Companion, named</i> Nello, <i>made</i> Calandrino <i>to
beleeve, that he was conceived great with childe. And having Physicke
ministred to him for the disease: they got both good fatte Capons
and money of him, and so cured him, without any other manner
of deliverance.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Third Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Discovering the simplicity of some silly witted men, and how easie a
matter it is to abuse and beguile them.</i></h4>


<p>After that Madame <i>Eliza</i> had concluded her Novell, and
every one of the company given thankes to Fortune, for
delivering poore <i>Isabella</i> the faire young Nunne, from the
bitter reprehensions of the as faulty Abbesse, as also the malice of
her envious Sisters: the Queene gave command unto <i>Philostratus</i>,
that he should be the next in order, and hee (without expecting anie
other warning) began in this manner.</p>

<p>Faire Ladies, the paltry Judge of the Marquisate, whereof yesterday
I made relation to you; hindred mee then of another Novell,
concerning silly <i>Calandrino</i>, wherewith I purpose now to acquaint
you. And because whatsoever hath already bin spoken of him, tended
to no other end but matter of merriment, hee and his companions
duly considered: the Novel which I shal now report, keepeth
within the selfesame compasse, and aimeth also at your contentment,
according to the scope of imposed variety.</p>

<p>You have already heard what manner of man <i>Calandrino</i> was,
and likewise the rest of his pleasant Companions, who likewise are
now againe to be remembred, because they are actors in our present
discourse. It came so to passe, that an Aunt of <i>Calandrinoes</i> dying,
left him a legacy of two hundred Florines, wherewith he purposed
to purchase some small Farme-house in the countrey, or else to enlarge
the other, whereof he was possessed already. And, as if hee
were to disburse some ten thousand Florines, there was not a Broker
in all <i>Florence</i>, but understood what he intended to doe; and all
the worst was, that the strings of his purse could stretch no higher.
<i>Bruno</i>, and <i>Buffalmaco</i> (his auncient Confederates) who heard of
this good Fortune befalne him, advised him in such manner as they
were wont to do; allowing it much better for him, to make merrie
with the money in good cheare among them, then to lay it out in
paltry Land, whereto he would not by any meanes listen, but ridde
himselfe of them with a dinners cost, as loath to bee at anie further
charge with them.</p>

<p>These merry Laddes meant not to leave him so; but sitting one
day in serious consultation, and a third man in their companie, named
<i>Nello</i>; they all three layde their braines in steep, by what means
to wash their mouths well, and <i>Calandrino</i> to bee at the cost thereof.</p>

<p>And having resolved what was to bee done, they met togither
the next morning, even as <i>Calandrino</i> was comming foorth of his
house, and sundering themselves, to avoyd all suspition, yet beeing
not farre distant each from other; <i>Nello</i> first met him, and saide unto
him, Good Morrow <i>Calandrino</i>: which he requited backe agayne
with the same salutation. But then <i>Nello</i> standing still, looked him
stedfastly in the face: whereat <i>Calandrino</i> mervailing, sayd: <i>Nello</i>,
why dost thou behold me so advisedly? Whereunto <i>Nello</i> answered,
saying Hast thou felt any paine this last night past? Thou lookest nothing
so well, as thou didst yesterday. <i>Calandrino</i> began instantly to
wax doubtfull, and replyed thus. Dost thou see any alteration in my
face, whereby to imagine, I should feele some paine? In good faith <i>Calandrino</i>
(quoth <i>Nello</i>) me thinks thy countenance is strangely changed,
and surely it proceedeth from some great cause, and so he departed
away from him.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> being very mistrustfull, scratched his head, yet felte
he no grievance at all; and going still on; <i>Buffalmaco</i> sodainely
encountred him, upon his departure from <i>Nello</i>, and after salutations
passing betweene them; in a manner of admiration, demanded
what he ayled.</p>

<p>Truly (quoth <i>Calandrino</i>) well enough to mine owne thinking, yet
notwithstanding, I met with <i>Nello</i> but even now; and he told me, that
my countenance was very much altred; Is it possible that I should bee
sicke, and feele no paine or distaste in any part of me? <i>Buffalmaco</i> answered;
I am not so skilfull in judgement, as to argue on the Nature
of distemper in the body: but sure I am, that thou hast some daungerous
inward impediment, because thou lookst (almost) like a man more
then halfe dead.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> began presently to shake, as if hee had had a Feaver
hanging on him, and then came <i>Bruno</i> looking fearefully on him,
and before he would utter any words, seemed greatly to bemoane
him, saying at length. <i>Calandrino</i>? Art thou the same man, or no?
How wonderfully art thou changed since last I saw thee, which is no
longer then yester day? I pray thee tell mee, How dooest thou feele thy
health?</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> hearing, that they all agreed in one opinion of him;
he beganne verily to perswade himselfe, that some sodaine sicknes,
had seised upon him, which they could discerne, although hee felt
no anguish at all: and therefore, like a man much perplexed in
minde, demanded of them, What he should do? Beleeve mee <i>Calandrino</i>
(answered <i>Bruno</i>) if I were worthy to give thee counsell, thou
shouldst returne home presently to thy house, and lay thee downe
in thy warme Bedde, covered with so many cloathes as thou canst
well endure. Then to Morrow morning, send thy Water unto
Learned Mayster Doctor the Physitian, who (as thou knowest) is
a man of most singular skill and experience: he will instruct thee
presently what is the best course to be taken, and we that have ever
beene thy loving friends, will not faile thee in any thing that lieth in
our power.</p>

<p>By this time, <i>Nello</i> being come againe unto them, they all returned
home with <i>Calandrino</i> unto his owne house, whereinto he entering
very faintly, hee saide to his Wife: Woman, make my Bed
presently ready, for I feele my selfe to be growne extreamely sicke,
and see that thou layest cloathes enow upon me. Being thus laide in
his Bedde, they left him for that night, and returned to visite him
againe the verie next morning, by which time, he had made a reservation
of his Water, and sent it by a young Damosell unto Maister
Doctor, who dwelt then in the olde market place, at the signe
of the Muske Mellone. Then saide <i>Bruno</i> unto his Companions;
Abide you heere to keepe him company, and I will walke along to
the Physitian, to understand what he will say: and if neede be, I can
procure him to come hither with me. <i>Calandrino</i> very kindely accepted
his offer, saying withall. Well <i>Bruno</i>, thou shewst thy selfe
a friend in the time of necessity, I pray thee know of him, how the
case stands with me, for I feele a very strange alteration within mee,
far beyond all compasse of my conceite.</p>

<p><i>Bruno</i> being gone to the Physitian, he made such expedition, that
he arrived there before the Damosell, who carried the Water, and
informed Master <i>Simon</i> with the whole tricke intended: wherefore,
when the Damosell was come, and hee had passed his judgement
concerning the water, he said to her.</p>

<p>Maide, go home againe, and tell <i>Calandrino</i>, that he must keepe
himselfe very warme: and I my selfe will instantly be with him, to
enstruct him further in the quality of his sicknesse.</p>

<p>The Damosell delivered her message accordingly, and it was not
long before Mayster Doctor <i>Simon</i> came, with <i>Bruno</i> also in his
company, and sitting downe on the beds side by <i>Calandrino</i>, hee
began to taste his pulse, and within a small while after, his Wife
being come into the Chamber, he said. Observe me well <i>Calandrino</i>,
for I speake to thee in the nature of a true friend; thou hast no other
disease, but only thou art great with child.</p>

<p>So soone as <i>Calandrino</i> heard these words, in dispairing manner
he beganne to rage, and cry out aloud, saying to his wife. Ah thou
wicked woman, this is long of thee, and thou hast done me this mischeefe:
for alwayes thou wilt be upon me, ever railing at mee, and
fighting, untill thou hast gotten me under thee. Say thou divellish
creature, do I not tell thee true? The Woman, being of verie honest
and civill conversation, hearing her husband speake so foolishly:
blushing with shame, and hanging downe her head in bashfull
manner; without returning any answer, went forth of her Chamber.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> continuing still in his angry humour, wringing his
hands, and beating them upon his brest, said: Wretched man that
I am, What shall I do? How shal I be delivered of this child? Which
way can it come from me into the world? I plainly perceyve, that
I am none other then a dead man, and all through the wickednesse
of my Wife: heaven plague her with as many mischiefes, as I am
desirous to finde ease. Were I now in as good health, as heeretofore
I have beene, I would rise out of my bed, and never cease beating
her, untill I had broken her in a thousand peeces. But if Fortune
will be so favourable to me, as to helpe mee out of this dangerous
agony: hang me, if ever she get me under her againe, or make
me such an Asse, in having the mastery over mee, as divers times
she hath done.</p>

<p><i>Bruno, Buffalmaco</i> and <i>Nello</i>, hearing these raving speeches of
<i>Calandrino</i>, were swolne so bigge with laughter, as if their ribbes
would have burst in sunder; neverthelesse, they abstained so well
as they were able; but Doctor <i>Simon</i> gaped so wide with laughing
as one might easily have pluckt out all his teeth. In the end, because
he could tarry there no longer, but was preparing to depart:
<i>Calandrino</i> thanked him for his paines, requesting that hee would
be carefull of him, in aiding him with his best advise and counsell,
and he would not be unmindfull of him. Honest neighbour <i>Calandrino</i>,
answered the Phisition, I would not have you to torment
your selfe, in such an impatient and tempestuous manner, because
I perceive the time so to hasten on, as we shall soone perceive (and
that within very few dayes space) your health well restored, and
without the sense of much paine; but indeed it wil cost expences.
Alas Sir, said <i>Calandrino</i>, make not any spare of my purse, to procure
that I may have safe deliverance. I have two hundred Florines,
lately falne to me by the death of mine Aunt, wherewith I intended
to purchase a Farme in the Countrey: take them all if need be,
onely reserving some few for my lying in Childbed. And then
Master Doctor, Alas, I know not how to behave my selfe, for I have
heard the grievous complaint of women in that case, oppressed
with bitter pangs and throwes; as questionlesse they will bee my
death, except you have the greater care of me.</p>

<p>Be of good cheere neighbour <i>Calandrino</i>, replyed Doctor <i>Simon</i>,
I will provide an excellent distilled drinke for you, marvellously
pleasing in taste, and of soveraigne vertue, which will resolve
all in three mornings, making you as whole and as sound as a
Fish newly spawned. But you must have an especiall care afterward,
being providently wise, least you fall into the like follies againe.
Concerning the preparation of this precious drinke,
halfe a dozen of Capons, the very fairest and fattest, I must make
use of in the distillation: what other things shall bee imployed beside,
you may deliver forty Florines to one of these your honest
friends, to see all the necessaries bought, and sent me home to my
house. Concerning my businesse, make you no doubt thereof, for
I will have all distilled against to morrow, and then doe you drinke
a great Glasse full every morning, fresh and fasting next your
heart. <i>Calandrino</i> was highly pleased with his words, returning master
Doctor infinite thankes, and referring all to his disposing. And
having given forty Florines to <i>Bruno</i>, with other money beside, to
buy the halfe dozen of Capons: he thought himselfe greatly beholding
to them all, and protested to requite their kindenesse.</p>

<p>Master Doctor being gone home to his house, made ready a
bottel of very excellent Hypocrasse, which he sent the next day according
to his promise: and <i>Bruno</i> having bought the Capons,
with other junkets, fit for the turne, the Phisitian and his merry
Companions, fed on them hartely for the givers sake. As for <i>Calandrino</i>,
he liked his dyet drinke excellently well, quaffing a large
Glassefull off three mornings together: afterward Master Doctor
and the rest came to see him, and having felt his pulse, the Phisition
said. <i>Calandrino</i>, thou art now as sound in health, as any man in all
<i>Florence</i> can be: thou needest not to keepe within doores any longer,
but walke abroad boldly, for all is well and the childe gone.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> arose like a joyfulll man, and walked daily through
the streets, in the performance of such affaires as belonged to him:
and every acquaintance he met withall, he told the condition of his
sudden sickenesse; and what a rare cure Master Doctor <i>Simon</i> had
wrought on him, delivering him (in three dayes space) of a childe,
and without the feeling of any paine. <i>Bruno, Buffalmaco,</i> and <i>Nello,</i>
were not a little jocond, for meeting so well with covetous <i>Calandrino</i>:
but how the Wife liked the folly of her Husband, I leave
to the judgement of all good Women.</p>

clothed himselfe in his Masters wearing garments, and (mounted

and walked bare-footed.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The fourth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Serving as an admonition to all men, for taking Gamesters and Drunkards
into their service.</i></h4>


<p>The ridiculous words given by <i>Calandrino</i> to his Wife, all
the whole company hartily laughed at: but <i>Philostratus</i>
ceassing, Madame <i>Neiphila</i> (as it pleased the Queene
to appoint) began to speake thus. Vertuous Ladies, if it were not
more hard and uneasie for men, to make good their understanding
and vertue, then apparant publication of their disgrace and folly;
many would not labour in vaine, to curbe in their idle speeches
with a bridle, as you have manifestly observed by the weake wit of
<i>Calandrino</i>. Who needed no such fantastick circumstance, to cure
the strange disease, which he imagined (by sottish perswasions) to
have: had hee not been so lavish of his tongue, and accused his
Wife of over-mastering him. Which maketh me remember a Novell,
quite contrary to this last related, namely, how one man may
strive to surmount another in malice; yet he to sustaine the greater
harme, that had (at the first) the most advantage of his enemy, as I
will presently declare unto you.</p>

<p>There dwelt in <i>Sienna</i>, and not many yeeres since, two young
men of equall age, both of them bearing the name of <i>Francesco</i>: but
the one was descended of the <i>Aniollieri</i>, and the other likewise of
the <i>Fortarigi</i>; so that they were commonly called <i>Aniolliero</i>, and
<i>Fortarigo</i>, both Gentlemen, and well derived. Now, although in
many other matters, their complexions did differ very much: Yet
notwithstanding, they varied not in one bad qualitie, namely too
great neglect of their Fathers, which caused their more frequent
conversation, as very familiar and respective friends. But <i>Aniolliero</i>
(being a very goodly and faire conditioned young Gentleman)
apparently perceiving, that he could not maintaine himselfe at <i>Sienna</i>,
in such estate as he liked, and upon the pension allowed him by
his Father, hearing also, that at the Marquisate of <i>Ancona</i>, there lived
the Popes Legate, a worthy Cardinall, his much indeared
good Lord and friend: he intended to goe visite him, as hoping
to advance his fortunes by him.</p>

<p>Having acquainted his Father with this determination, he concluded
with him, to have that from him in a moment which might
supply his wants for many moneths, because he would be clothed
gallantly, and mounted honourably. And seeking for a servant
necessary to attend on him, it chanced that <i>Fortarigo</i> hearing thereof,
came presently to <i>Aniolliero</i>, intreating him in the best manner
he could, to let him waite on him as his serving man, promising
both dutifull and diligent attendance: yet not to demaund any other
wages, but onely payment of his ordinary expences. <i>Aniolliero</i>
made him answere, that he durst not give him entertainment, not
in regard of his insufficiency, and unaptnesse for service: but because
he was a great Gamester, and divers times would be beastly
drunke? whereto <i>Fortarigo</i> replyed that hee would refraine from
both those foule vices, and addict all his endeavour wholly to please
him, without just taxation of any grosse error; making such solemne
vowes and protestations beside, as conquered <i>Aniolliero</i>,
and won his consent.</p>

<p>Being entred upon his journey, and arriving in a morning at
<i>Buonconvento</i>, there <i>Aniolliero</i> determined to dine, and afterward,
finding the heate to be unfit for travaile; he caused a bed to be prepared,
wherein being laid to rest by the helpe of <i>Fortarigo</i>, he gave
him charge, that after the heates violence was overpast, hee should
not faile to call and awake him. While <i>Aniolliero</i> slept thus in
his bed, <i>Fortarigo</i>, never remembring his solemne vowes and promises:
went to the Taverne, where having drunke indifferently, and
finding company fit for the purpose, he fell to play at the dice with
them. In a very short while, he had not onely lost his money, but
all the cloathes on his backe likewise, and coveting to recover his
losses againe; naked in his shirt, he went to <i>Aniollieroes</i> Chamber,
where finding him yet soundly sleeping, he tooke all the money he
had in his purse, and then returned backe to play, speeding in the
same manner as hee did before, not having one poore penny left
him.</p>

<p><i>Aniolliero</i> chancing to awake, arose and made him ready, without
any servant to helpe him; then calling for <i>Fortarigo</i>, and not
hearing any tydings of him: he began immediately to imagine,
that he was become drunke, and so had falne asleepe in one place
or other, as very often he was wont to doe. Wherefore, determining
so to leave him, he caused the male and Saddle to be set on his
horse; &amp; so to furnish himselfe with a more honest servant at <i>Corsignano</i>.</p>

<p>But when hee came to pay his hoste, hee found not any penny
left him: whereupon (as well he might) he grew greatly offended,
and raised much trouble in the house, charged the hoasts people to
have robde him, and threatening to have them sent as prisoners
to <i>Sienna</i>. Suddenly entred <i>Fortarigo</i> in his shirt, with intent to
have stolne <i>Aniollieroes</i> garments, as formerly hee did the money
out of his purse, and seeing him ready to mount on horsebacke, hee
saide.</p>

<p>How now <i>Aniolliero</i>? What shall we goe away so soone?
I pray you Sir tarry a little while, for an honest man is comming
hither, who hath my Doublet engaged for eight and thirty shillings;
and I am sure that he will restore it me back for five and thirty,
if I could presently pay him downe the money.</p>

<p>During the speeches, an other entred among them, who assured
<i>Aniolliero</i>, that <i>Fortarigo</i> was the Thiefe which robde him of his
money, shewing him also how much hee had lost at the Dice:
Wherewith <i>Aniolliero</i> being much mooved, very angerly reprooved
<i>Fortarigo</i>, and, but for feare of the Law, would have offered
him outrage, thretning to have him hangd by the neck, or else condemned
to the Gallies belonging to <i>Florence</i>, and so mounted on
his horse. <i>Fortarigo</i> making shew to the standers by, as if <i>Aniolliero</i>
menaced some other body, and not him, said. Come <i>Aniolliero</i>,
I pray thee let us leave this frivolous prating, for (indeede) it is
not worth a Button, and minde a matter of more importance: my
Doublet will bee had againe for five and thirty shillings, if the
money may bee tendered downe at this very instant, whereas if we
deferre it till to morrow, perhaps hee will then have the whole
eight and thirty which he lent me, and he doth me this pleasure, because
I am ready (at another time) to affoord him the like courtesie;
why then should we loose three shillings, when they may so easily
be saved.</p>

<p><i>Aniolliero</i> hearing him speake in such confused manner, and perceiving
also, that they which stood gazing by, beleeved (as by their
lookes appeared) that <i>Fortarigo</i> had not played away his Masters
mony at the Dice, but rather that he had some stocke of <i>Fortarigoes</i>
in his custody; angerly answered; Thou sawcy companion, what
have I to doe with thy Doublet? I would thou wert hangd, not only
for playing away my money, but also by delaying thus my journey,
and yet boldly thou standest out-facing mee, as if I were no
better then thy fellow. <i>Fortarigo</i> held on still his former behaviour,
without using any respect or reverence to <i>Aniolliero</i>, as if all
the accusations did not concerne him, but saying, Why should wee
not take the advantage of three shillings profit? Thinkest thou, that
I am not able to doe as much for thee? why, lay out so much money
for my sake, and make no more haste then needs we must, because
we have day-light enough to bring us (before night) to <i>Torreniero</i>.
Come, draw thy purse, and pay the money, for upon mine
honest word, I may enquire throughout all <i>Sienna</i>, and yet not find
such another Doublet as this of mine is. To say then, that I should
leave it, where it now lyeth pawned, and for eight and thirty shillings,
when it is richly more worth then fifty, I am sure to suffer a
double endammagement thereby.</p>

<p>You may well imagine, that <i>Aniolliero</i> was now enraged beyond
all patience, to see himselfe both robde of his money, and overborne
with presumptuous language: wherefore, without making
any more replications, he gave the spurre to his horse, and rode away
towards <i>Torreniero</i>. Now fell <i>Fortarigo</i> into a more knavish
intention against <i>Aniolliero</i>, and being very speedy in running, followed
apace after him in his shirt, crying out still aloude to him all
the way, to let him have his Doublet againe. <i>Aniolliero</i> riding on
very fast, to free his eares from this idle importunity, it fortuned
that <i>Fortarigo</i> espied divers countrey Pezants, labouring in the fields
about their businesse, and by whom <i>Aniolliero</i> (of necessity) must
passe: To them he cryed out so loude as he could; Stay the Thiefe,
Stop the Thiefe, he rides away so fast, having robde me.</p>

<p>They being provided, some with Prongges, Pitchforkes and
Spades, and others with the like weapons fit for Husbandry, stept
into the way before <i>Aniolliero</i>: and beleeving undoubtedly, that
he had robde the man which pursued him in his shirt, stayed and
apprehended him. Whatsoever <i>Aniolliero</i> could doe or say, prevailed
not any thing with the unmannerly Clownes, but when <i>Fortarigo</i>
was arrived among them, he braved <i>Aniolliero</i> most impudently,
saying.</p>

<p>What reason have I to spoile thy life (thou traiterous Villaine)
to rob and spoyle thy Master thus on the high way? Then turning
to the Countrey Boores: How much deare friends (quoth he) am
I beholding to you for this unexpected kindnesse? You behold in
what manner he left me in my Lodging, having first playd away all
my money at the Dice, and then deceiving me of my horse and garments
also: but had not you (by great good lucke) thus holpe mee
to stay him; a poore Gentleman had bin undone for ever, and I
should never have found him againe.</p>

<p><i>Aniolliero</i> avouched the truth of his wrong received, but the base
peazants, giving credite onely to <i>Fortarigoes</i> lying exclamations:
tooke him from his horse, despoyled him of all his wearing apparrell,
even to the very Bootes from off his Legges: suffered him to
ride away from him in that manner, and <i>Aniolliero</i> left so in his
shirt, to dance a bare-foote Galliard after him, either towards <i>Sienna</i>,
or any place else.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Aniolliero</i>, purposing to visite his Cousin the Cardinal like
a Gallant, and at the Marquisate of <i>Ancona</i>, returned backe poorly
in his shirt unto <i>Buonconvento</i>, and durst not (for shame) repaire to
<i>Sienna</i>. In the end, he borrowed money on the other horse which
<i>Fortarigo</i> rode on, and remained there in the Inne, whence riding
to <i>Corsignano</i>, where he had divers Kinsmen and Friends, he continued
there so long with them, till he was better furnished from his
Father.</p>

<p>Thus you may perceive, that the cunning Villanies of <i>Fortarigo</i>,
hindred the honest intended enterprise of <i>Aniolliero</i>, howbeit in fit
time and place, nothing afterward was left unpunished.</p>

her. She being gone to an appointed place with him, hee was found
there by his wife, and dealt withall according to his deserving.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The fift Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>In just reprehension of those vaine-headed fooles, that are led and governed
by idle perswasions.</i></h4>


<p>Because the Novell reported by Madame <i>Neiphila</i> was so
soone concluded, without much laughter, or commendation
of the whole Company: the Queene turned hir selfe
towards Madam <i>Fiammetta</i>, enjoyning her to succeed in apt order;
&amp; she being as ready as sodainly commanded, began as followeth.
Most gentle Ladies, I am perswaded of your opinion in judgement
with mine, that there is not any thing, which can bee spoken pleasingly,
except it be conveniently suited with apt time and place: in
which respect, when Ladies and Gentlewomen are bent to discoursing,
the due election of them both are necessarily required. And
therefore I am not unmindfull, that our meeting heere (ayming at
nothing more, then to out-weare the time with our generall contentment)
should tye us to the course of our pleasure and recreation,
to the same conveniency of time and place, not sparing, though
some have bin nominated oftentimes in our passed arguments; yet,
if occasion serve, and the nature of variety be well considered, wee
may speake of the selfsame persons againe.</p>

<p>Now, notwithstanding the actions of <i>Calandrino</i> have been indifferently
canvazed among us; yet, remembring what <i>Philostratus</i>
not long since saide, That they intended to nothing more then matter
of mirth: I presume the boldlier, to report another Novell of
him, beside them already past. And, were I willing to conceale the
truth, and cloath it in more circumstantiall manner: I could make use
of contrary names, and paint it in a poeticall fiction, perhaps more
probable, though not so pleasing. But because wandring from the
truth of things, doth much diminish (in relation) the delight of the
hearers: I will build boldly on my fore-alledged reason, and tel you
truly how it hapned.</p>

<p><i>Niccholao Cornocchini</i> was once a Citizen of ours, and a man of
great wealth; who, among other his rich possessions in <i>Camerata</i>,
builded there a very goodly house, which being perfected ready for
painting: he compounded with <i>Bruno</i> and <i>Buffalmaco</i>, who because
their worke required more helpe then their owne, they drew <i>Nello</i>
and <i>Calandrino</i> into their association, and began to proceed in their
businesse. And because there was a Chamber or two, having olde
moveables in them, as Bedding, Tables, and other Houshold stuffe
beside, which were in the custody of an old Woman that kepte the
house, without the helpe of any other servants else, a Son unto the
saide <i>Niccholao</i>, beeing named <i>Phillippo</i>, resorted thither divers
times, with one or other pretty Damosell in his company (in regard
he was unmarried) where he would abide a day or two with her, &amp;
then convey her home againe.</p>

<p>At one time among the rest, it chanced that he brought a Damosell
thither named <i>Nicholetta</i>, who was maintained by a wily companion,
called <i>Magione</i>, in a dwelling which hee had at <i>Camaldoli</i>,
and (indeed) no honester then she should be. She was a very beautifull
young woman, wearing garments of great value, and (according
to her quality) well spoken, and of commendable carriage.
Comming forth of her Chamber one day, covered with a White
veyle, because her haire hung loose about her, which shee went to
wash at a Well in the middle Court, bathing there also her face and
hands: <i>Calandrino</i> going (by chance) to the same Well for water,
gave her a secret salutation. She kindly returning the like courtesie
to him, began to observe him advisedly: more, because he looked
like a man newly come thither, then any handsomnesse she perceyved
in him.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> threw wanton glances at her, and seeing she was both
faire and lovely, began to finde some occasion of tarrying, so that
he returned not with water to his other associates, yet neither knowing
her, or daring to deliver one word. She, who was not to learn
her lesson in alluring, noting what affectionate regards (with bashfulnesse)
he gave her: answered him more boldly with the like; but
meerly in scorning manner, breathing forth divers dissembled sighs
among them: so that <i>Calandrino</i> became foolishly inveigled with
her love, and would not depart out of the Court, untill <i>Phillippo</i>,
standing above in his Chamber window called her thence.</p>

<p>When <i>Calandrino</i> was returned backe to his businesse, he could
do nothing else, but shake the head, sigh, puffe, and blowe, which
being observed by <i>Bruno</i> (who alwayes fitted him according to his
folly, as making a meer mockery of his very best behaviour) sodainly
he said. Why how now <i>Calandrino</i>? Sigh, puff, and blow man?
What may be the reason of these unwonted qualities? <i>Calandrino</i>
immediately answered, saying: My friendly Companion <i>Bruno</i>, if
I had one to lend me a little helpe, I should very quickely become
well enough. How? quoth <i>Bruno</i>, doth any thing offend thee, and
wilt thou not reveale it to thy friends? Deare <i>Bruno</i>, said <i>Calandrino</i>,
there is a proper handsome woman here in the house, the goodliest
creature that every any eye beheld, much fairer then the Queen
of Fairies her selfe, who is so deeply falne in love with mee, as thou
wouldst thinke it no lesse then a wonder; and yet I never sawe her
before, till yet while when I was sent to fetch water. A very strange
case, answered <i>Bruno</i>, take heede <i>Calandrino</i>, that shee bee not the
lovely friend to <i>Phillippo</i>, our young Master, for then it may prove a
dangerous matter.</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> stood scratching his head an indifferent while, and
then sodainly replyed thus. Now trust me <i>Bruno</i>, it is to bee doubted,
because he called her at his Window, and she immediately went
up to his Chamber. But what doe I care if it be so? Have not the
Gods themselves bene beguiled of their Wenches, who were better
men then ever <i>Phillippo</i> can be, and shall I stand in feare of him?
<i>Bruno</i> replied: Be patient <i>Calandrino</i>, I will enquire what Woman
she is, and if she be not the wife or friend to our young master <i>Phillippo</i>,
with faire perswasions I can over-rule the matter, because shee
is a familiar acquaintance of mine. But how shall wee doe, that
<i>Buffalmaco</i> may not know heereof? I can never speake to her, if hee
be in my company. For <i>Buffalmaco</i> (quoth <i>Calandrino</i>) I have no
feare of all, but rather of <i>Nello</i>, because he is a neer Kinsman to my
wife, and he is able to undo me quite, if once it should come to his
hearing. Thou saist well, replyed <i>Bruno</i>, therefore the matter hath
neede to be very cleanly carried.</p>

<p>Now let me tell you, the Woman was well enough knowne to
<i>Bruno</i>, as also her quality of life, which <i>Phillippo</i> had acquainted
him withall, and the reason of her resorting thither. Wherefore,
<i>Calandrino</i> going forth of the roome where they wrought, onely to
gaine another sight of <i>Nicholetta, Bruno</i> revealed the whole history
to <i>Buffalmaco</i> and <i>Nello</i>; they all concluding together, how this amorous
fit of the foole was to be followed. And when <i>Calandrino</i>
was returned backe againe; in whispering manner <i>Bruno</i> said to him.
Hast thou once more seene her? Yes, yes <i>Bruno</i>, answered <i>Calandrino</i>:
Alas, she hath slaine me with her very eye, and I am no better
then a dead man. Be patient said <i>Bruno</i>, I will goe and see whether
she be the same woman which I take her for, or no: and if it prove
so, then never feare, but refer the businesse unto me.</p>

<p><i>Bruno</i> descending downe the staires, found <i>Phillippo</i> and <i>Nicholetta</i>
in conference together, and stepping unto them, discoursed at
large, what manner of man <i>Calandrino</i> was, and how farre he was
falne in love with her: so that they made a merry conclusion, what
should be performed in this case, onely to make a pastime of his hot
begun love. And being come backe againe to <i>Calandrino</i>, he saide.
It is the same woman whereof I told thee, and therefore wee must
worke wisely in the businesse: for if <i>Phillippo</i> perceive any thing, all
the water in <i>Arno</i> will hardly serve to quench his fury. But what
wouldst thou have me say to her on thy behalfe, if I compasse the
meanes to speake with her? First of all (quoth <i>Calandrino</i>) and in
the prime place, tell her, that I wish infinite bushels of those blessings,
which makes Maides Mothers, and begetteth children. Next,
that I am onely hers, in any service she wil command me. Dooest
thou understand me what I say? Sufficiently answered <i>Bruno</i>, leave
all to me.</p>

<p>When supper time was come, that they gave over working, and
were descended downe into the Court: there they found <i>Phillippo</i>
and <i>Nicholetta</i> readily attending to expect some beginning of amorous
behaviour, and <i>Calandrino</i> glanced such leering lookes at her,
coughing and spetting with hummes and haes, yea in such close and
secret manner, that a starke blinde sight might verie easily have perceyved
it.</p>

<p>She also on the other side, returned him such queint and cunning
carriage, as enflamed him farre more furiously, even as if hee
were ready to leape out of himselfe. In the meane while, <i>Phillippo,
Buffalmaco</i> and the rest that were there present, seeming as if they
were seriouslie consulting together, and perceived nothing of his
fantastick behaviour, according as <i>Bruno</i> had appointed, could scarse
refraine from extremity of laughter, they noted such antick trickes
in <i>Calandrino</i>.</p>

<p>Having spent an indifferent space in this foppish folly, the houre
of parting came, but not without wonderful affliction to <i>Calandrino</i>;
and as they were going towards <i>Florence, Bruno</i> saide closely to
<i>Calandrino</i>. I dare assure thee, that thou hast made her to consume
and melt, even like ice against the warme Sunne. On my word, if
thou wouldst bring thy Gitterne, and sit downe by us, singing some
few amorous songs of thine owne making, when we are beneath about
our businesse in the Court: shee would presently leape out of
the Window, as being unable to tarry from thee.</p>

<p>I like thy counsell well <i>Bruno</i>, answered <i>Calandrino</i>; but shall I
bring my Gitterne thither indeed? Yes, in any case, replied <i>Bruno</i>,
for Musicke is a matter of mighty prevailing. Ah <i>Bruno</i> (quoth <i>Calandrino</i>)
thou wouldst not credit me in the morning, when I tolde
thee, how the very sight of my person had wounded her: I perceived
it at the very first looke of her owne, for shee had no power to
conceale it. Who but my selfe could so soone have enflamed her
affection, and being a woman of such worth and beauty as shee is?
There are infinite proper handsome fellowes, that daily haunt the
company of dainty Damosels, yet are so shallow in the affayres of
love, as they are not able to win one wench of a thousand, no, not
with all the wit they have, such is their extreame follie and ill fortune.</p>

<p>Then pausing a while, and sodainely rapping out a Lovers Oath
or two, thus he proceeded. My dearest <i>Bruno</i>, thou shalt see how I
can tickle my Gitterne, and what good sport will ensue thereon. If
thou dost observe me with judgement, why man, I am not so old as
I seeme to be, and she could perceive it at the very first view; yea,
and she shall finde it so too, when we have leysure to consult upon
further occasions: I finde my selfe in such a free and frolicke jocunditie
of spirit, that I will make her to follow me, even as a fond woman
doth after her child.</p>

<p>But beware, saide <i>Bruno</i>, that thou do not gripe her over-hard,
and in kissing, bee carefull of biting, because the teeth stand in thy
head like the pegges of a Lute, yet make a comely shew in thy faire
wide mouth, thy cheekes looking like two of our artificiall Roses,
swelling amiably, when thy jawes are well fild with meat. <i>Calandrino</i>
hearing these hansome commendations, thought himselfe a man
of action already, going, singing, and frisking before his companie
so lively, as if he had not bin in his skin.</p>

<p>On the morrow, carrying his Gitterne thither with him, to the no
little delight of his companions, hee both played and sung a whole
Bed-role of Songs, not addicting himselfe to any worke all the day:
but loitering fantastically, one while he gazed out at the window,
then ran to the gate, and oftentimes downe into the Court, onely
to have a sight of his Mistresse. She also (as cunningly) encountred
all his follies, by such directions as <i>Bruno</i> gave her, and many more
beside of her owne devising, to quicken him still with new occasions;
<i>Bruno</i> plaid the Ambassador betweene them, in delivering the
messages from <i>Calandrino</i>, and then returning her answers to him.
Sometimes when she was absent thence (which often hapned as occasions
called her) then he would write letters in her name, &amp; bring
them, as if they were sent by her, to give him hope of what hee desired,
but because she was then among her kindred, yet she could not
be unmindfull of him.</p>

<p>In this manner, <i>Bruno</i> and <i>Buffalmaco</i> (who had the managing of
this amorous businesse) made a meere Gregory of poore <i>Calandrino</i>,
causing him somtimes to send her, one while a pretty peece of
Ivory, then a faire wrought purse, and a costly paire of knives, with
other such like friendly tokens: bringing him backe againe, as in requitall
of them, counterfetted Rings of no valew, Bugles and bables,
which he esteemed as matters of great moment. Moreover, at divers
close and sodain meetings, they made him pay for many dinners &amp;
suppers, amounting to indifferent charges, onely to be carefull in the
furtherance of his love-suit, and to conceale it from his wife.</p>

<p>Having worne out three or foure months space in this fond and
frivolous manner, without any other successe then as hath bene declared;
and <i>Calandrino</i> perceiving, that the works undertaken by
him and his fellowes, grew very neere uppon the finishing, which
would barre him of any longer resorting thither: hee began to solicite
<i>Bruno</i> more importunately, then all the while before he hadde
done. In regard whereof, <i>Nicholetta</i> being one day come thither, &amp;
<i>Bruno</i> having conferred both with her and <i>Phillippo</i>, with full determination
what was to be done, he began with <i>Calandrino</i>, saying.
My honest Neighbour and Friend, this Woman hath made a thousand
promises, to graunt what thou art so desirous to have, and I
plainly perceive that she hath no such meaning, but meerely plaies
with both our noses. In which respect, seeing she is so perfidious,
and will not perfourme one of all her faithfull-made promises: if
thou wilt content to have it so, she shall be compelled to do it whether
she will or no. Yea marry <i>Bruno</i>, answered <i>Calandrino</i>, that
were an excellent course indeede, if it could be done, and with expedition.</p>

<p><i>Bruno</i> stood musing awhile to himselfe, as if he had some strange
stratagem in his braine, &amp; afterward said. Hast thou so much corage
<i>Calandrino</i>, as but to handle a peece of written parchment, which I
will give thee? Yes, that I have answered <i>Calandrino</i>, I hope that
needed not to be doubted. Well then, saide <i>Bruno</i>, procure that I
may have a piece of Virgin Parchment brought mee, with a living
Bat or Reremouse; three graines of Incense, and an hallowed Candle,
then leave me to effect what shal content thee. <i>Calandrino</i> watched
all the next night following, with such preparation as he could
make, onely to catch a Bat; which being taken at the last, he broght
it alive to <i>Bruno</i> (with all the other materials appointed) who taking
him alone into a backer Chamber, there hee wrote divers follies
on the Parchment, in the shape of strange and unusuall Charracters,
which he delivered to <i>Calandrino</i>, saying: Be bold <i>Calandrino</i>,
and build constantly uppon my wordes, that if thou canst but
touch her with this sacred Charractred charme, she will immediately
follow thee, and fulfill whatsoever thou pleasest to command hir.
Wherefore, if <i>Phillippo</i> do this day walke any whither abroad from
this house, presume to salute her, in any manner whatsoever it be, &amp;
touching her with the written lines, go presently to the barn of hay,
which thou perceivest so neere adjoyning, the onely convenient
place that can be, because few or none resort thither. She shall (in
despight of her blood) follow thee; and when thou hast her there,
I leave thee then to thy valiant victory. <i>Calandrino</i> stood on tiptoe,
like a man newly molded by Fortune, and warranted <i>Bruno</i> to fulfill
all effectually.</p>

<p><i>Nello</i>, whom <i>Calandrino</i> most of all feared and mistrusted, had a
hand as deepe as any of the rest in this deceite, and was as forward
also to have it performed, by <i>Brunoes</i> direction, hee went unto <i>Florence</i>,
where being in company with <i>Calandrinoes</i> Wife, thus hee
began.</p>

<p>Cousine, thine unkinde usage by thine husband, is not unknown
to me, how he did beate thee (beyond the compasse of all reason)
when he brought home stones from the plain of <i>Mugnone</i>; in which
regard, I am very desirous to have thee revenged on him: which if
thou wilt not do; never repute me heereafter for thy Kinsman and
Friend. He is falne in love with a Woman of the common gender,
one that is to be hired for money: he hath his private meetings with
her, and the place is partly knowne to me, as by a secret appointment
(made very lately) I am credibly given to understand; wherefore
walke presently along with me, and thou shalt take him in the
heat of his knavery.</p>

<p>All the while as these words were uttering to her, shee could not
dissemble her inward impatience, but starting up as halfe franticke
with fury, she said. O notorious villaine! Darest thou abuse thine
honest wife so basely? I sweare by blessed Saint <i>Bridget</i>, thou shalt
be paid with coyne of thine owne stampe. So casting a light wearing
Cloake about her, and taking a young woman in her company;
shee went away with <i>Nello</i> in no meane haste. <i>Bruno</i> seeing her
comming a farre off, said to <i>Phillippo</i>: You Sir, you know what is
to be done, act your part according to your appointment. <i>Phillippo</i>
went immediately into the roome, where <i>Calandrino</i> and his other
Consorts were at worke, and said to them. Honest friends, I have
certaine occasions which command mine instant being at <i>Florence</i>:
worke hard while I am absent, and I will not be unthankefull for it.
Away hee departed from them, and hid himselfe in a convenient
place, where he could not be descryed, yet see whatsoever <i>Calandrino</i>
did: who when he imagined <i>Phillippo</i> to be farre enough off,
descended downe into the Court, where he found <i>Nicholetta</i> sitting
alone, and going towards her, began to enter into discoursing
with her.</p>

<p>She knowing what remained to bee done on her behalfe, drew
somewhat neere him, and shewed her selfe more familiar then formerly
she had done: by which favourable meanes, he touched her
with the charmed Parchment, which was no sooner done; but without
using any other kinde of language, hee went to the hay-Barne,
whither <i>Nicholetta</i> followed him, and both being entred, he closed
the Barne doore, and then stood gazing on her, as if hee had never
seene her before. Standing stil as in a study, or bethinking himselfe
what he should say: she began to use affable gesture to him, and taking
him by the hand, made shew as if shee meant to kisse him,
which yet she refrained, though he (rather then his life) would gladly
have had it. Why how now deare <i>Calandrino</i> (quoth she) jewell
of my joy, comfort of my heart, how many times have I longed
for thy sweet Company? And enjoying it now, according to mine
owne desire, dost thou stand like a Statue, or man <i>alla morte</i>? The
rare tunes of the Gitterne, but (much more) the melodious accents
of thy voyce, excelling <i>Orpheus</i> or <i>Amphion</i>, so ravished my soule,
as I know not how to expresse the depth of mine affection; and yet
hast thou brought me hither, onely to looke babies in mine eyes,
and not so much as speake one kinde word to me?</p>

<p><i>Bruno</i> and <i>Buffalmaco</i>, having hid themselves close behinde <i>Phillippo</i>,
they both heard and saw all this amourous conflict, and as
<i>Calandrino</i> was quickning his courage, and wiping his mouth, with
intent to kisse her: his wife and <i>Nello</i> entred into the Barne, which
caused <i>Nicholetta</i> to get her gone presently, sheltring her self where
<i>Phillippo</i> lay scouting. But the enraged woman ranne furiously
upon poore daunted <i>Calandrino</i>, making such a pitifull massacre
with her nailes, and tearing the haire from his head, as hee
meerely looked like an infected Anatomy. Fowle loathsome dog
(quoth she) must you be at your minions, and leave mee hunger-starved
at home? An olde knave with (almost) never a good tooth
in thy head, and yet art thou neighing after young wenches? hast
thou not worke enough at home, but must bee gadding in to other
mens grounds? Are these the fruites of wandring abroad?</p>

<p><i>Calandrino</i> being in this pittifull perplexity, stood like one neither
alive nor dead, nor daring to use any resistance against her; but
fell on his knees before his Wife, holding up his hands for mercy,
and entreating her (for charities sake) not to torment him any more:
for he had committed no harme at all, and the Gentlewoman was
his Masters Wife, who came with no such intent thither, as shee
fondly imagined. Wife, or wife not (quoth she) I would have none
to meddle with my Husband, but I that have the most right to
him.</p>

<p><i>Bruno</i> and <i>Buffalmaco</i>, who had laughed all this while heartily at
this pastime, with <i>Phillippo</i> and <i>Nicholetta</i>; came running in haste
to know the reason of this loude noise, and after they had pacified
the woman with gentle perswasions: they advised <i>Calandrino</i> to
walke with his Wife to <i>Florence</i>, and returne no more to worke
there againe, least <i>Phillippo</i> hearing what had hapned, should be revenged
on him with some outrage. Thus poore <i>Calandrino</i> miserably
misused and beaten, went home to <i>Florence</i> with his Wife,
scoulded and raild at all the way, beside his other mollestations (day
and night) afterward: his Companions, <i>Phillippo</i> and <i>Nicholetta</i>,
making themselves merry at his mis-fortune.</p>

<h4><a name="Two_young_Gentlemen_the_one_named_Panuccio_and_the_other_Adriano" id="Two_young_Gentlemen_the_one_named_Panuccio_and_the_other_Adriano"><i>Two young Gentlemen, the one named</i> Panuccio, <i>and the other</i> Adriano,
<i>lodged one night in a poore Inne, where one of them went to bed
to the Hostes Daughter, and the other (by mistaking his way in the
darke) to the Hostes wife. He which lay with the daughter, happened
afterward to the Hostes bed, and told him what he had done, as
thinking he spake to his owne companyon. Discontentment growing
betweene them, the Mother perceiving her error, went to bed
to her daughter, and with discreete language, made a generall pacification.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Sixt Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is manifested, that an offence committed ignorantly, and by
mistaking; ought to be covered with good advise, and civill discretion.</i></h4>


<p><i>Calandrino</i>, whose mishaps had so many times made the
whole assembly merry, and this last passing among them
with indifferent commendations: upon a generall silence
commanded, the Queene gave order to <i>Pamphilus</i>, that hee should
follow next, as indeed he did, beginning thus. Praise-worthy Ladies,
the name of <i>Nicholetta</i>, so fondly affected by <i>Calandrino</i>, putteth
mee in minde of a Novell, concerning another <i>Nicholetta</i>,
of whom I purpose to speake: to the ende you may observe
how by a sudden wary fore-sight, a discreet woman compassed the
meanes to avoyde a notorious scandall.</p>

<p>On the plaine of <i>Mugnone</i>, neere to <i>Florence</i>, dwelt (not long
since) an honest meane man, who kept a poore Inne or Ostery for
travellers, where they might have some slender entertainement for
their money. As he was but a poore man, so his house affoorded
but very small receit of guests, not lodging any but on necessity,
and such as he had some knowledge of. This honest poore hoste
had a woman (sufficiently faire) to his wife, by whom hee had also
two children, the one a comely young maiden, aged about fifteene
yeares, and the other a sonne, not fully (as yet) a yeare old, and sucking
on the mothers brest.</p>

<p>A comely youthfull Gentleman of our City, became amorously
affected to the Damosell, resorting thither divers times as hee travelled
on the way, to expresse how much he did respect her. And
she accounting her fortune none of the meanest, to bee beloved by
so youthfull a Gallant, declared such vertuous and modest demeanour,
as might deserve his best opinion of her: so that their love
grew to an equall simpathy, and mutuall contentment of them
both, in expectation of further effects; he being named <i>Panuccio</i>,
and she <i>Nicholetta</i>.</p>

<p>The heate of affection thus encreasing day by day, <i>Panuccio</i>
grew exceedingly desirous to enjoy the fruits of his long continued
liking, and divers devises mustred in his braine, how he might compasse
one nights lodging in her fathers house, whereof hee knew every
part and parcell, as not doubting to effect what hee desired,
yet undiscovered by any, but the maide her selfe.</p>

<p>According as his intention aymed, so he longed to put it in execution,
and having imparted his mind to an honest loyall friend,
named <i>Adriano</i>, who was acquainted with the course of his love:
hyring two horses, and having Portmantues behind them, filled
with matters of no moment, they departed from <i>Florence</i>, as if they
had some great journey to ride. Having spent the day time where
themselves best pleased, darke night being entred, they arrived on
the plaine of <i>Mugnone</i>, where, as if they were come from the parts
of <i>Romanio</i>, they rode directly to this poore Inne, and knocking at
the doore, the honest Hoste (being familiar and friendly to all commers)
opened the doore, when <i>Panuccio</i> spake in this manner to
him. Good man, we must request one nights lodging with you,
for we thought to have reached so farre as <i>Florence</i>, but dark night
preventing us, you see at what a late houre wee are come hither.
Signior <i>Panuccio</i>, answered the hoste, it is not unknowne to you,
how unfiting my poore house is, for entertaining such guests as you
are: Neverthelesse, seeing you are overtaken by so unseasonable an
houre, and no other place is neere for your receite; I will gladly
lodge you so well as I can.</p>

<p>When they were dismounted from their horses, and entred into
the simple Inne: having taken order for feeding their horses, they
accepted such provision, as the place and time afforded, requesting
the Hoste to suppe with them. Now I am to tell you, that there
was but one small Chamber in the house, wherein stood three beds,
as best the Hoste had devised to place them, two of them standing
by the walles side, and the third fronting them both, but with such
close and narrow passage, as very hardly could one step betweene
them. The best of these three beds was appointed for the Gentlemen,
and therein theyd lay them down to rest, but sleepe they could
not, albeit they dissembled it very formally. In the second Bed
was <i>Nicholetta</i> the daughter, lodged by her selfe, and the father and
mother in the third, and because she was to give the child sucke in
the night time, the Cradle (wherein it lay) stood close by their
beds side, because the childes crying or any other occasion concerning
it, should not disquiet the Gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Panuccio</i> having subtily observed all this, and in what manner
they went to bed; after such a space of time, as he imagined them
to be all fast asleepe, he arose very softly, and stealing to the bed of
<i>Nicholetta</i>, lay downe gently by her. And albeit she seemed somewhat
affraid at the first, yet when she perceived who it was, shee rather
bad him welcome, then shewed her selfe any way discontented.
Now while <i>Panuccio</i> continued thus with the maide, it fortuned
that a Cat threw down somewhat in the house, the noise whereof
awaked the wife, and fearing greater harme, then (indeed) had
hapned, she arose without a Candle, and went groping in the darke,
towards the place where shee heard the noyse. <i>Adriano</i>, who had
no other meaning but well, found occasion also to rise, about some
naturall necessity, and making his passage in the darke, stumbled on
the childes Cradle (in the way) where the woman had set it, and being
unable to passe by, without removing it from the place: tooke
and set it by his owne beds side, and having done the businesse for
which he rose, returned to his bed againe, never remembring to
set the Cradle where first he found it.</p>

<p>The Wife having found the thing throwne downe being of no
value or moment, cared not for lighting any candle; but rating the
Cat, returned backe, feeling for the bed where her Husband lay, but
finding not the Cradle there, she said to her selfe. What a foolish
woman am I, that cannot well tell my selfe what I doe? Instead of
my Husbands bed, I am going to both my guests.</p>

<p>So, stepping on a little further, she found the childes Cradle, and
laid her selfe downe by <i>Adriano</i>, thinking shee had gone right to
her Husband. <i>Adriano</i> being not yet falne asleepe, feeling the hostesse
in bed with him: tooke advantage of so faire an occasion offered,
and what he did, is no businesse of mine, (as I heard) neither
found the woman any fault. Matters comming to passe in this
strange manner, and <i>Panuccio</i> fearing, lest sleepe seazing on him,
he might disgrace the maides reputation: taking his kinde farewell
of her, with many kisses and sweet imbraces: returned againe
to his owne Bed, but meeting with the Cradle in his way, and thinking
it stood by the hostes Bed, (as truely it did so at the first) went
backe from the Cradle, and stept into the hostes Bed indeed, who
awaked upon his very entrance, albeit he slept very soundly before.</p>

<p><i>Panuccio</i> supposing that he was laid downe by his loving friend
<i>Adriano</i>, merrily said to the Hoste. I protest to thee, as I am a Gentleman,
<i>Nicholetta</i> is a dainty delicate wench, and worthy to be a
very good mans wife: this night shee hath given mee the sweetest
entertainement, as the best Prince in the world can wish no better,
and I have kist her most kindly for it. The Hoste hearing these
newes, which seemed very unwelcome to him, said first to himself:
What make such a devill heere in my Bedde? Afterward being
more rashly angry, then well advised, hee said to <i>Panuccio</i>. Canst
thou makes vaunt of such a mounstrous villany? Or thinkest thou,
that heaven hath not due vengeance in store, to requite all wicked
deeds of darkenesse? If all should sleepe, yet I have courage sufficient
to right my wrong, and yet as olde as I am thou shalt be sure to
finde it.</p>

<p>Our amorous <i>Panuccio</i> being none of the wisest young men
in the world, perceiving his error; sought not to amend it, (as well
he might have done) with some queint straine of wit, carried in
quicke and cleanly manner, but angerly answered. What shall I
find that thou darst doe to me? am I any way affraid of thy threatnings?
The Hostes imagining she was in bed with her Husband,
said to <i>Adriano</i>: Harke Husband, I thinke our Guests are quarrelling
together, I hope they will doe no harme to one another. <i>Adriano</i>
laughing outright, answered. Let them alone, and become
friends againe as they fell out: perhaps they dranke too much yesternight.</p>

<p>The woman perceiving that it was her husband that quarrelled,
and distinguishing the voyce of <i>Adriano</i> from his: knew presently
where shee was, and with whom; wherefore having wit at will,
and desirous to cloude an error unadvisedly committed, and with
no willing consent of her selfe: without returning any more words,
presently she rose, and taking the Cradle with the child in it, removed
it thence to her daughters bed side, although shee had no
light to helpe her, and afterward went to bed to her, where (as if
she were but newly awaked) she called her Husband, to understand
what angry speeches had past betweene him and <i>Panuccio</i>. The
Hoste replyed, saying. Didst thou not heare him wife, brag &amp; boast,
how he hath lyen this night with our daughter <i>Nicholetta</i>? Husband
(quoth she) he is no honest Gentleman; if hee should say so,
and beleeve me it is a manifest lye, for I am in bed with her my
selfe, and never yet closed mine eyes together, since the first houre I
laid me downe: it is unmannerly done of him to speake it, and you
are little lesse then a logger-head, if you doe beleeve it. This proceedeth
from your bibbing and swilling yesternight, which (as it
seemeth) maketh you to walke about the roome in your sleepe,
dreaming of wonders in the night season: it were no great sinne if
you brake your necks, to teach you keepe a fairer quarter; and how
commeth it to passe, that Signior <i>Panuccio</i> could not keepe himselfe
in his owne bed?</p>

<p><i>Adriano</i> (on the other side) perceiving how wisely the woman
excused her owne shame and her daughters; to backe her in a businesse
so cunningly begun, he called to <i>Panuccio</i>, saying. Have not I
tolde thee an hundred times, that thou art not fit to lye any where;
out of thine owne lodging? What a shame is this base imperfection
to thee, by rising and walking thus in the night-time, according
as thy dreames doe wantonly delude thee, and cause thee to forsake
thy bed, telling nothing but lies and fables, yet avouching them for
manifest truthes? Assuredly this will procure no meane perill unto
thee: Come hither, and keepe in thine owne bedde for meere
shame.</p>

<p>When the honest meaning Host heard, what his own Wife and
<i>Adriano</i> had confirmed: he was verily perswaded, that <i>Panuccio</i>
spake in a dreame all this while: And to make it the more constantly
apparant, <i>Panuccio</i> (being now growne wiser by others example)
lay talking and blundring to himselfe, even as if dreames or
perturbations of the minde did much molest him, with strange distractions
in franticke manner. Which the Hoste perceiving, and
compassionating his case, as one man should do anothers: he tooke
him by the shoulders, jogging and hunching him, saying. Awake
Signior <i>Panuccio</i>, and get you gone hence to your owne bed.</p>

<p><i>Panuccio</i>, yawning and stretching out his limbes, with unusuall
groanes and respirations, such as (better) could bee hardly dissembled:
seemed to wake as out of a traunce, and calling his friend
<i>Adriano</i>, said.</p>

<p><i>Adriano</i>, is it day, that thou dost waken me? It may be day or
night replyed <i>Adriano</i>, for both (in these fits) are alike to thee. Arise
man for shame, and come to thine lodging. Then faining to be
much troubled and sleepie, he arose from the hoast, and went to <i>Adrianoes</i>
bed.</p>

<p>When it was day, and all in the house risen, the hoast began to
smile at <i>Panuccio</i>, mocking him with his idle dreaming and talking
in the night.</p>

<p>So, falling from one merry matter to another, yet without any
mislike at all: the Gentlemen, having their horses prepared, and
their Portmantues fastened behind, drinking to their hoast, mounted
on horsebacke, and they roade away towards <i>Florence</i>, no lesse
contented with the manner of occasions happened, then the effects
they sorted to. Afterward, other courses were taken, for the continuance
of this begun pleasure with <i>Nicholetta</i>, who made her mother
beleeve, that <i>Panuccio</i> did nothing else but dreame. And the
mother her selfe remembring how kindely <i>Adriano</i> had used
her (a fortune not expected by her before:) was more then halfe
of the minde, that she did then dreame also, while she was waking.</p>

<h2>The Seventh Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Whereby (with some indifferent reason) it is concluded, that Dreames
do not alwayes fall out to be leasings.</i></h4>


<p>By the conclusion of <i>Pamphilus</i> his Novel, wherein the womans
ready wit, at a time of such necessity, carried deserved
commendations: the Queen gave command to Madam
<i>Pampinea</i>, that she should next begin with hers, and so she did,
in this manner. In some discourses (gracious Ladies) already past
among us, the truth of apparitions in dreames hath partly bin approved,
whereof very many have made a mockery. Neverthelesse,
whatsoever hath heeretofore bin sayde, I purpose to acquaint you
with a very short Novell, of a strange accident happening unto a
neighbour of mine, in not crediting a Dreame which her Husband
told her.</p>

<p>I cannot tell, whether you knew <i>Talano de Molese</i>, or no, a man
of much honour, who tooke to wife a young Gentlewoman, named
<i>Margarita</i>, as beautifull as the best: but yet so peevish, scornefull,
and fantasticall, that she disdained any good advice given her; neyther
could any thing be done, to cause her contentment; which absurd
humors were highly displeasing to her husband: but in regard
he knew not how to helpe it, constrainedly he did endure it. It came
to passe, that <i>Talano</i> being with his wife, at a summer-house of his
owne in the country, he dreamed one night, that he saw his Wife
walking in a faire wood, which adjoyned neere unto his house, and
while she thus continued there, he seemed to see issue foorth from a
corner of the said Wood, a great and furious Wolfe, which leaping
sodainly on her, caught her by the face and throate, drawing
her downe to the earth, and offering to drag her thence. But he crying
out for helpe, recovered her from the Wolfe, yet having her
face and throat very pitifully rent and torne.</p>

<p>In regard of this terrifying dreame, when <i>Talano</i> was risen in the
morning, and sate conversing with his wife, he spake thus unto hir.
Woman, although thy froward wilfull Nature be such, as hath not
permitted me one pleasing day with thee, since first we becam man
and wife, but rather my life hath bene most tedious to me, as fearing
still some mischeefe should happen to thee: yet let mee now in loving
manner advise thee, to follow my counsell, and (this day) not
to walke abroad out of this house. She demanded a reason for this
advice of his. He related to her every particular of his dreame, adding
with all these speeches.</p>

<p>True it is Wife (quoth he) that little credit should bee given to
dreames: neverthelesse, when they deliver advertisement of harmes
to ensue, there is nothing lost by shunning and avoiding them. She
fleering in his face, and shaking her head at him, replyed. Such
harmes as thou wishest, such thou dreamest of. Thou pretendest
much pittie and care of me, but all to no other end: but what mischeefes
thou dreamest happening unto mee, so wouldest thou see
them effected on me. Wherefore, I will well enough looke to my
selfe, both this day, and at all times else: because thou shalt never
make thy selfe merry, with any such misfortune as thou wishest unto
me.</p>

<p>Well Wife, answered <i>Talano</i>, I knew well enough before, what
thou wouldst say: An unsound head is soone scratcht with the very
gentlest Combe: but beleeve as thou pleasest. As for my selfe, I
speake with a true and honest meaning soule, and once againe I do
advise thee, to keepe within our doores all this day: at least wife beware,
that thou walke not into our wood, bee it but in regard of my
dreame. Well sir (quoth she scoffingly) once you shall say, I followed
your counsell: but within her selfe she fell to this murmuring.
Now I perceive my husbands cunning colouring, &amp; why I must not
walke this day into our wood: he hath made a compact with some
common Queane, closely to have her company there, and is affraide
least I shold take them tardy. Belike he would have me feed among
blinde folke, and I were worthy to bee thought a starke foole, if I
should not prevent a manifest trechery, being intended against me.
Go thither therefore I will, and tarry there all the whole day long;
but I will meet with him in his merchandize, and see the Pink wherein
he adventures.</p>

<p>After this her secret consultation, her husband was no sooner
gone forth at one doore, but shee did the like at another, yet so secretly
as possibly she could devise to doe, and (without any delaying)
she went to the Wood, wherein she hid her selfe very closely,
among the thickest of the bushes, yet could discerne every way about
her, if any body should offer to passe by her. While shee kept
her selfe in this concealment, suspecting other mysterious matters,
as her idle imagination had tutord her, rather then the danger of any
Wolfe; out of a brakie thicket by her, sodainly rushed a huge &amp;
dreadfull Wolfe, as having found her by the sent, mounting uppe,
and grasping her throat in his mouth, before she saw him, or could
call to heaven for mercy.</p>

<p>Being thus seised of her, he carried her as lightly away, as if shee
had bin no heavier then a Lambe, she being (by no meanes) able to
cry, because he held her so fast by the throate, and hindred any helping
of her selfe. As the Wolfe carried her thus from thence, he had
quite strangled her, if certaine Shepheards had not met him, who
with their outcries and exclaimes at the Wolfe, caused him to let
her fall, and hast away to save his owne life. Notwithstanding the
harme done to her throat and face, the shepheards knew her, and
caried her home to her house, where she remained a long while after,
carefully attended by Physitians and Chirurgians.</p>

<p>Now, although they were very expert and cunning men all, yet
could they not so perfectly cure her, but both her throate, and part
of her face were so blemished, that whereas she seemed a rare creature
before, she was now deformed and much unsightly. In regard
of which strange alteration, being ashamed to shew her selfe in any
place, where formerly she had bene seene: she spent her time in sorrow
and mourning, repenting her insolent and scornfull carriage, as
also her rash running forth into danger, upon a foolish and jealous
surmise, beleeving her husbands dreames the better for ever after.</p>

a good dinner: for which deceit,</i> Guiotto <i>became cunningly revenged,
by procuring</i> Blondello <i>to be unreasonably beaten and misused.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Eight Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Whereby plainly appeareth, that they which take delight in deceiving
others, do well deserve to be deceived themselves.</i></h4>


<p>It was a generall opinion in the whole Joviall Companie,
that whatsoever <i>Talano</i> saw in his sleepe, was not anie
dreame, but rather a vision: considring, every part thereof
fell out so directly, without the lest failing. But when silence was
enjoyned, then the Queene gave forth by evident demonstration,
that Madam <i>Lauretta</i> was next to succeed, whereupon she thus began.
As all they (judicious hearers) which have this day spoken before
me, derived the ground or project of their Novels, from some
other argument spoken of before: even so, the cruell revenge of
the Scholler, yesterday discoursed at large by Madame <i>Pampinea</i>,
maketh me to remember another Tale of like nature, some-what
greevous to the sufferer, yet not in such cruell measure inflicted, as
that on Madam <i>Helena</i>.</p>

<p>There dwelt sometime in <i>Florence</i>, one who was generally called
by the name of <i>Guiotto</i>, a man being the greatest Gourmand, and
grossest feeder, as ever was seene in any Countrey, all his meanes &amp;
procurements meerly unable to maintaine expences for filling his
belly. But otherwise he was of sufficient and commendable carriage,
fairely demeaned, and well discoursing on any argument: yet,
not as a curious and spruce Courtier, but rather a frequenter of
rich mens Tables, where choice of good cheere is sildome wanting,
&amp; such should have his company, albeit not invited, yet (like a bold
intruder) he had the courage to bid himselfe welcome.</p>

<p>At the same time, and in our City of <i>Florence</i> also, there was another
man, named <i>Blondello</i>, very low of stature; yet comely formed,
quicke witted, more neat and brisk then a Butter flye, alwaies wearing
a wrought silke cap on his head, and not a haire staring out of
order, but the tuft flourishing above the forehead, and he such another
trencher-fly for the table, as our forenamed <i>Guiotto</i> was. It so
fel out on a morning in the Lent time, that hee went into the Fish-market,
where he bought two goodly Lampreyes, for <i>Messer Viero
de Cherchi</i>, and was espied by <i>Guiotto</i>, who (comming to <i>Blondello</i>)
said. What is the meaning of this cost, and for whom is it? Whereto
<i>Blondello</i> thus answered. Yesternight, three other Lampries, far
fairer and fatter then these, and a whole Sturgeon, were sent unto
<i>Messer Corso Donati</i>, and being not sufficient to feede divers Gentlemen,
whom hee hath invited this day to dine with him, hee caused
me to buy these two beside: Doest not thou intend to make one among
them? Yes I warrant thee, replied <i>Guiotto</i>, thou knowst I can
invite my selfe thither, without any other bidding.</p>

<p>So parting; about the houre of dinner time, <i>Guiotto</i> went to the
house of the saide <i>Messer Corso</i>, whom he found sitting and talking
with certain of his neighbours, but dinner was not (as yet) ready, neither
were they come thither to dinner. <i>Messer Corso</i> demaunded of
<i>Guiotto</i>, what newes with him, and whither he went? Why Sir (said
<i>Guiotto</i>) I come to dine with you, and your good company. Whereto
<i>Messer Corso</i> answered, That he was welcome, &amp; his other friends
being gone, dinner was served in, none else thereat present but <i>Messer
Corso</i> and <i>Guiotto</i>: al the diet being a poore dish of Pease, a little piece
of Tunny, &amp; a few small dishes fried, without any other dishes to follow
after. <i>Guiotto</i> seeing no better fare, but being disapointed of his
expectation, as longing to feed on the Lampries and Sturgeon, and
so to have made a full dinner indeed: was of a quick apprehension, &amp;
apparantly perceived, that <i>Blondello</i> had meerly guld him in a knavery,
which did not a little vex him, and made him vow to be revenged
on <i>Blondello</i>, as he could compasse occasion afterward.</p>

<p>Before many daies were past, it was his fortune to meete with
<i>Blondello</i>, who having told this jest to divers of his friends, and much
good merriment made thereat: he saluted <i>Guiotto</i> in ceremonious
manner, saying. How didst thou like the fat Lampreyes and Sturgeon,
which thou fedst on at the house of <i>Messer Corso Donati</i>? Wel
Sir (answered <i>Guiotto</i>) perhaps before eight dayes passe over my
head, thou shalt meet with as pleasing a dinner as I did. So, parting
away from <i>Blondello</i>, he met with a Porter or burthen-bearer, such
as are usually sent on errands; and hyring him to deliver a message
for him, gave him a glasse bottle, and bringing him neere to the Hal-house
of <i>Cavicciuli</i>, shewed him there a knight, called <i>Signior Phillippo
Argenti</i>, a man of huge stature, stout, strong, vainglorious, fierce
and sooner mooved to anger then any other man. To him (quoth
<i>Guiotto</i>) thou must go with this bottle in thy hand, and say thus to
him. Sir, <i>Blondello</i> sent me to you, and courteously entreateth you,
that you would enrubinate this glasse bottle with your best Claret
Wine; because he would make merry with a few friends of his. But
beware he lay no hand on thee, because he may bee easily induced
to misuse thee, and so my businesse be disappointed. Well Sir replied
the Porter, shal I say any thing else unto him? No (quoth <i>Guiotto</i>)
only go and deliver this message, and when thou art returned, Ile
pay thee for thy paines.</p>

<p>The Porter being gone to the house, delivered his message to the
knight, who being a man of no great civill breeding, but furious,
rash, and inconsiderate: presently conceived, that <i>Blondello</i> (whom
he knew well enough) sent this message in meere mockage of him,
and starting up with fiery lookes, said: What enrubination of Claret
should I send him? and what have I to do with him, or his drunken
friends? Let him and thee go hang your selves together. So he
stept to catch hold on the Porter, but he (being well warnd before)
was quicke and nimble, and escaping from him, returned backe to
<i>Guiotto</i> (who observed all) and told him the answer of Signior <i>Phillippo.
Guiotto</i> not a little contented, paied the Porter, and taried not
in any place til he met with <i>Blondello</i>, to whom he said. When wast
thou at the Hall of <i>Cavicciuli</i>? Not a long while, answerd <i>Blondello</i>,
but why dost thou demand such a question? Because (quoth <i>Guiotto</i>)
Signior <i>Phillippo</i> hath sought about for thee, yet knowe not I
what he would have with thee. Is it so? replied <i>Blondello</i>, then I wil
walke thither presently, to understand his pleasure.</p>

<p>When <i>Blondello</i> was thus parted from him, <i>Guiotto</i> followed not
farre off behind him, to behold the issue of this angry businesse; and
Signior <i>Phillippo</i>, because he could not catch the Porter, continued
much distempred, fretting and fuming, in regard he could not comprehend
the meaning of the Porters message: but onely surmized,
that <i>Blondello</i> (by the procurement of some body else) had done this
in scorne of him. While he remained thus deeply discontented, he
espied <i>Blondello</i> comming towards him, and meeting him by the
way, he stept close to him, and gave him a cruell blow on the face,
causing his nose to fall out a bleeding. Alas Sir, said <i>Blondello</i>, wherefore
do you strike me? Signior <i>Phillippo</i>, catching him by the haire
of the head, trampled his wrought night-cap in the dirt, &amp; his cloke
also; when, laying many violent blowes on him, he said. Villanous
Traitor as thou art, Ile teach thee what it is to enrubinate with Claret,
either thy selfe, or any of thy cupping companions: Am I a
child, to be jested withall?</p>

<p>Nor was he more furious in words, then in strokes also, beating
him about the face, hardly leaving any haire on his head, and dragging
him along in the mire, spoyling all his garments, and he not able
(from the first blow given) to speake a word in defence of himselfe.
In the end, Signior <i>Phillippo</i> having extreamly beaten him,
and many people gathering about them, to succour a man so much
misused, the matter was at large related, and manner of the message
sending. For which, they all present, did greatly reprehend <i>Blondello</i>,
considering he knew what kinde of man <i>Phillippo</i> was, not any
way to be jested withall. <i>Blondello</i> in teares constantly maintained,
that he never sent any such message for wine, or intended it in the
least degree: so, when the tempest was more mildly calmed, and
<i>Blondello</i> (thus cruelly beaten and durtied) had gotten home to his
owne house, he could then remember, that (questionles) this was
occasioned by <i>Guiotto</i>.</p>

<p>After some few dayes were passed over, and the hurts in his face
indifferently cured; <i>Blondello</i> beginning to walke abroade againe,
chanced to meet with <i>Guiotto</i>: who laughing heartily at him, sayde.
Tell me <i>Blondello</i>, how doost thou like the enrubinating Clarret of
Signior <i>Phillippo</i>? As well (quoth <i>Blondello</i>) as thou didst the Sturgeon
and Lampreyes at <i>Messer Corso Donaties</i>. Why then (sayde
<i>Guiotto</i>) let these two tokens continue familiar betweene thee and
me, when thou wouldst bestow such another dinner on mee, then
wil I enrubinate thy nose with a bottle of the same Claret. But <i>Blondello</i>
perceived (to his cost) that hee had met with the worser bargaine,
and <i>Guiotto</i> got cheare, without any blowes: and therefore
desired a peacefull attonement, each of them (alwayes after) abstaining
from flouting one another.</p>

learne what he should do, whereby to compasse and winne the love of
men. The other craved to be enstructed, by what meanes hee might
reclaime an headstrong and unruly wife. And what answeres the
wise King gave unto them both, before they departed away from
him.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Ninth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Containing an excellent admonition, that such as covet to have the
love of other men, must first learne themselves, how to love: Also, by
what meanes such women as are curst and self-willed, may be reduced
to civill obedience.</i></h4>


<p>Upon the conclusion of Madame <i>Laurettaes</i> Novell, none
now remained to succeede next in order, but onely the
Queene her selfe, the priviledge reserved, granted to <i>Dioneus</i>;
wherefore, after they had all smiled at the folly of <i>Blondello</i>,
with a chearfull countenance thus the Queene began.</p>

<p>Honourable Ladies, if with advised judgement, we do duly consider
the order of all things, we shall very easily perceyve, That the
whole universall multiplicitie of Women, by Nature, custome, and
lawes, are &amp; ought to be subject to men, yea, and to be governd by
their discretion. Because every one desiring to enjoy peace, repose
and comfort with them, under whose charge they are; ought to be
humble, patient and obedient, over and beside her spotlesse honesty,
which is the crowne and honour of every good woman. And although
those lawes, which respect the common good of all things,
or rather use &amp; custome (as our wonted saying is) the powers whereof
are very great, and worthy to be referenced, should not make us
wise in this case. Yet Nature hath given us a sufficient demonstration,
in creating our bodies more soft and delicate, yea, and our
hearts timorous, fearefull, benigne and compassionable, our strength
feeble, our voyces pleasing, and the motion of our members sweetly
plyant; all which are apparant testimonies, that wee have neede
of others government.</p>

<p>Now, it is not to be denyed, that whosoever hath need of helpe,
and is to bee governed: meerely reason commandeth, that they
should bee subject and obedient to their governour. Who then
should we have for our helps and governours, if not men? Wherefore,
we should be intirely subject to them, in giving them due honour
and reverence, and such a one as shall depart from this rule:
she (in mine opinion) is not onely worthy of grievous reprehension, but
also severe chastisement beside. And to this exact consideration
(over and above divers other important reasons) I am
the rather induced, by the Novel which Madame <i>Pampinea</i> so lately
reported, concerning the froward and wilfull wife of <i>Talano</i>,
who had a heavier punishment inflicted on her, then her Husband
could devise to doe. And therefore it is my peremptory sentence,
that all such women as will not be gracious, benigne and pleasing:
doe justly deserve (as I have already said) rude, rough and harsh
handling, as both nature, custome and lawes have commanded.</p>

<p>To make good what I have said, I wil declare unto you the counsell
&amp; advise, given by <i>Salomon</i>, the wise and famous King of Great
Britaine, as a most wholesome and soveraigne medicine for the
cure of such a dangerous disease, in any woman so fouly infected.
Which counsel (notwithstanding) all such women as have no need
of this Phisicke, I would not have them to imagine, that it was
meant for them, albeit men have a common Proverbe, to wit.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><i>
<span class="i0">As the good horse and bad horse, doe both need the spurre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So a good wife and bad wife, a wand will make stirre.<br /></span>
</i></div></div>

<p>Which saying, whosoever doth interpret it in such pleasing manner
as they ought, shal find it (as you al wil affirm no lesse) to be very
true: especially in the morall meaning, it is beyond all contradiction.
Women are naturally all unstable, and easily enclining to misgovernment;
wherefore to correct the iniquity of such a distemperature
in them that out-step the tearmes and bounds of womanhood,
a wand hath been allowed for especiall phisicke. As in the
like manner, for support of vertue, in those of contrary condition,
shaming to be sullyed with so grosse a sinne: the correcting Wand
may serve as a walking staffe, to protect them from all other feares.
But, forbearing to teach any longer; let mee proceed to my purpose,
and tell you my Novell.</p>

<p>In those ancient and reverend dayes, whereof I am now to speake,
the high renowne and admirable wisedome of <i>Salomon</i>, King of
Great Brittain, was most famous throughout all parts of the world;
for answering all doubtfull questions and demaunds whatsoever,
that possibly could be propounded to him. So that many resorted
to him, from the most remote and furthest off countreyes, to heare
his miraculous knowledge and experience, yea, and to crave his
counsell, in matters of greatest importance. Among the rest of them
which repaired thither, was a rich young Gentleman, honourably
descended, named <i>Melisso</i>, who came from the City of <i>Laiazzo</i>,
where he was both borne, and dwelt.</p>

<p>In his riding towards <i>France</i>, as he passed by <i>Naples</i>, hee overtooke
another young Gentleman, a native of <i>Antioch</i>, and named
<i>Giosefo</i>, whose journey lay the same way as the others did. Having
ridden in company some few dayes together, as it is a custome commonly
observed among Travellers, to understand one anothers
Countrey and condition, as also to what part his occasions call
him: so happened it with them, <i>Giosefo</i> directly telling him, that he
journeyed towards the wise King <i>Salomon</i>, to desire his advise what
meanes he should observe, in the reclaiming of a wilfull wife, the
most froward and selfe-willed woman that ever lived; whom neither
faire perswasions, nor gentle courtesies could in any manner
prevaile withall. Afterward he demaunded of <i>Melisso</i>, to know the
occasion of his travell, and whither.</p>

<p>Now trust me Sir, answered <i>Melisso</i>, I am a native of <i>Laiazzo</i>, and
as you are vexed with one great misfortune, even so am I offended
with another. I am young, wealthy, well derived by birth, and allow
liberall expences, for maintaining a worthy table in my house,
without distinguishing persons by their rancke and quality, but
make it free for all commers, both of the city, &amp; all places else. Notwithstanding
all which bounty and honourable entertainement, I
cannot meet with any man that loveth me. In which respect, I
journey to the same place as you doe, to crave the counsell of so
wise a King, what I should doe, whereby I might procure men to
love me. Thus like two well-met friendly companions, they rode
on together, untill they arrived in Great Britaine, where, by meanes
of the Noble Barons attending on the King; they were brought before
him. <i>Melisso</i> delivered his minde in very few words, whereto
the King made no other answere, but this: Learne to love. Which
was no sooner spoken, but <i>Melisso</i> was dismissed from the Kings
presence.</p>

<p><i>Giosefo</i> also relating, wherefore he came thither; the King replyed
onely thus; Goe to the Goose Bridge: and presently <i>Giosefo</i> had
also his dismission from the King. Comming forth, he found <i>Melisso</i>
attending for him, and revealed in what manner the King had
answered him: whereupon, they consulted together, concerning
both their answeres, which seemed either to exceed their comprehension,
or else was delivered them in meere mockery, and therefore
(more then halfe discontented) they returned homeward againe.</p>

<p>After they had ridden on a few dayes together, they came to a
River, over which was a goodly Bridge, and because a great company
of Horses and Mules (heavily laden, and after the manner of a
<i>Caravan</i> of Camels in <i>Egypt</i>) were first to passe over the saide
Bridge; they gladly stayed to permit their passe. The greater number
of them being already past over, there was one shie and skittish
Mule (belike subject to fearefull starting, as oftentimes we see horses
have the like ill quality) that would not passe over the Bridge by
any meanes, wherefore one of the Muletters tooke a good
Cudgell, and smote her at the first gently, as hoping so to procure
her passage. Notwithstanding, starting one while backeward, then
againe forward, side-wayes, and every way indeed, but the direct
Road way she would not goe.</p>

<p>Now grew the Muletter extreamely angry, giving her many
cruell stroakes, on the head, sides, flancks and all parts else, but yet
they proved to no purpose, which <i>Melisso</i> and <i>Giosefo</i> seeing, and
being (by this meanes) hindred of their passage, they called to the
Muletter, saying. Foolish fellow, what doest thou? Intendest thou
to kill the Mule? why dost thou not leade her gently, which is the
likelier course to prevaile by, then beating and misusing her as thou
dost? Content your selves Gentlemen (answered the Muletter) you
know your horses qualities, as I doe my Mules, let mee deale with
her as I please. Having thus spoken, he gave her so many violent
strokes, on head, sides, hippes, and every where else, as made her at
last passe over the Bridge quietly, so that the Muletter wonne the
Mastery of his Mule.</p>

<p>When <i>Melisso</i> and <i>Giosefo</i> had past over the Bridge, where they
intended to part each from other; a sudden motion happened into
the minde of <i>Melisso</i>, which caused him to demaund of an aged man
(who sate craving almes of Passengers at the Bridge foot) how the
Bridge was called: Sir, answered the old man, this is called, The
Goose Bridge. Which words when <i>Giosefo</i> heard, hee called to
minde the saying of King <i>Salomon</i>, and therefore immediately saide
to <i>Melisso</i>. Worthy friend, and partner in my travell, I dare now
assure you, that the counsell given me by King <i>Salomon</i>, may fall
out most effectuall and true: For I plainely perceive, that I knew
not how to handle my selfe-will'd-wife, untill the Muletter did instruct
me. So, requesting still to enjoy the others Company, they
journeyed on, till at the length they came to <i>Laiazzo</i>, where <i>Giosefo</i>
retained <i>Melisso</i> still with him, for some repose after so long a journey,
and entertained him with very honourable respect and courtesie.</p>

<p>One day <i>Giosefo</i> said to his Wife: Woman, this Gentleman is
my intimate friend, and hath borne me company in all my travell:
such dyet therfore as thou wilt welcome him withall, I would have
it ordered (in dressing) according to his direction. <i>Melisso</i> perceiving
that <i>Giosefo</i> would needs have it to be so; in few words directed
her such a course, as (for ever) might be to her Husbands contentment.
But she, not altring a jote from her former disposition,
but rather farre more froward and tempestuous: delighted to vexe
and crosse him, doing every thing, quite contrary to the order appointed.
Which <i>Giosefo</i> observing, angerly he said unto her. Was
it not tolde you by my friend, in what manner he would have our
Supper drest? She turning fiercely to him, replyed. Am I to be directed
by him or thee? Supper must and shall bee drest as I will
have it: if it pleaseth mee, I care not who doth dislike it; if thou
wouldst have it otherwise, goe seeke both your Suppers where you
may have it.</p>

<p><i>Melisso</i> marvelling at her froward answere, rebuked her for it in
very kind manner: whereupon, <i>Giosefo</i> spake thus to her. I perceive
wife, you are the same woman as you were wount to be: but
beleeve me on my word, I shal quite alter you from this curst complexion.
So turning to <i>Melisso</i>, thus he proceeded. Noble friend,
we shall try anone, whether the counsell of King <i>Salomon</i> bee effectuall,
or no; and I pray you, let it not be offensive to you to see it;
but rather hold all to be done in merriment. And because I would
not be hindered by you, doe but remember the answere which the
Muletter gave us, when we tooke compassion on his Mule. Worthy
friend, replyed <i>Melisso</i>, I am in your owne house, where I purpose
not to impeach whatsoever you doe.</p>

<p><i>Giosefo</i>, having provided a good Holly-wand, went into the
Chamber, where his wife sate railing, and despitefully grumbling,
where taking her by the haire of her head, he threw her at his feete,
beating her entreamely with the wand. She crying, then cursing,
next railing, lastly fighting, biting and scratching, when she felt the
cruell smart of the blowes, and that all her resistance served to no
end: then she fell on her knees before him, and desired mercy for
charities sake. <i>Giosefo</i> fought still more and more on head, armes,
shoulders, sides, and all parts else, pretending as if he heard not her
complaints, but wearied himselfe wel neere out of breath: so that
(to be briefe) she that never felt his fingers before, perceived and
confessed, it was now too soone. This being done, hee returned to
<i>Melisso</i>, and said: To morrow we shall see a miracle, and how available
the councell is of going to the Goose Bridge. So sitting a
while together, after they had washed their hands, and supt, they
withdrew to their lodgings.</p>

<p>The poore beaten woman, could hardly raise her selfe from the
ground, which yet (with much adoe) she did, and threw her selfe
upon the bed, where she tooke such rest as she could: but arising
early the next morning, she came to her Husband, and making him
a very low courtesie, demaunded what hee pleased to have for his
dinner; he smiling heartely thereat, with <i>Melisso</i>, tolde her his mind.
And when dinner time came, every thing was ready according to
the direction given: in which regard, they highly commended the
counsell, whereof they made such an harsh construction at the first.</p>

<p>Within a while after, <i>Melisso</i> being gone from <i>Giosefo</i>, and returned
home to his owne house: hee acquainted a wise and reverend
man, with the answere which king <i>Salomon</i> gave him, whereto hee
received this reply. No better or truer advise could possibly be
given you, for well you know, that you love not any man; but the
bountifull banquets you bestow on them, is more in respect of your
owne vaine-glory, then any kind affection you beare to them:
Learne then to love men, as <i>Salomon</i> advised, and you shall be beloved
of them againe. Thus our unruly Wife became mildely reclaimed,
and the young Gentleman, by loving others, found the
fruits of reciprocall affection.</p>

<h2>The Tenth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>In just reproofe of such foolish men, as will be governed by over-light
beleefe.</i></h4>


<p>This Novell reported by the Queene, caused a little murmuring
among the Ladies, albeit the men laughed heartely
thereat: but after they were all growne silent, <i>Dioneus</i>
began in this manner. Gracious Beauties, among many white
Doves, one blacke Crow will seeme more sightly, then the very
whitest Swanne can doe. In like manner, among a multitude of
wise men, sometimes one of much lesse wisedome and discretion,
shall not onely increase the splendour and Majestie of their maturity,
but also give an addition of delight and solace.</p>

<p>In which regard, you all being modest and discreet Ladies, and
my selfe more much defective in braine, then otherwise able: in
making your vertues shine gloriously, through the evident apparance
of mine owne weakenesse, you should esteeme the better of
mee, by how much I seeme the more cloudy and obscure. And
consequently, I ought to have the larger scope of liberty, by plainely
expressing what I am, and be the more patiently endured by
you all, in saying what absurdly I shall; then I should be if my speeches
favoured of absolute wisdome. I will therfore tell you a Tale,
which shall not be of any great length, whereby you may comprehend,
how carefully such things should be observed, which are
commanded by them, as can effect matters by the power of enchantment,
and how little delayance also ought to be in such, as
would not have an enchantment so be hindered.</p>

<p>About a yeare already past since, there dwelt at <i>Barletta</i>, an honest
man, called <i>John de Barolo</i>, who because he was of poore condition;
for maintenance in his contented estate, provided himselfe of
a Mule, to carry commodities from place to place, where Faires and
Markets were in request, but most especially to <i>Apuglia</i>, buying
and selling in the nature of a petty Chapman. Travelling thus thorow
the Countreyes, he grew into great and familiar acquaintance,
with one who named himselfe <i>Pietro da Trefanti</i>, following the
same Trade of life as he did, carrying his commodities upon an
Asse. In signe of amitie, according to the Countreyes custome, he
never tearmed him otherwise, then by the name of Gossip <i>Pietro</i>
and alwayes when he came to <i>Barletta</i>, he brought him to his own
house, taking it as his Inne, entreating him very friendly, and in the
best manner he could devise to doe. On the other side, Gossip <i>Pietro</i>
being very poore, having but one simple habitation in the village
of <i>Trefanti</i>, hardly sufficient for him, and an handsome young
woman which he had to his wife, as also his Asse: evermore when
<i>John de Barolo</i> came to <i>Trefanti</i>, he would bring him to his poore
abiding, with all his uttermost abilitie of entertainement, in due
acknowledgement of the courtesie he afforded to him at <i>Barletta</i>.
But when he came to take repose in the night-season, Gossip <i>Pietro</i>
could not lodge him as gladly he would: because he had but one
silly bed, wherein himselfe and his wife lay; so that <i>John de Barolo</i>
was faigne to lie on a little straw, in a small stable, close adjoyning
by his owne Mule and the Asse.</p>

<p>The woman understanding, what good and honest welcome,
Gossip <i>John</i> afforded her husband, when he came to <i>Barletta</i>, was
often very willing to goe lodge with an honest neighbour of hers,
called <i>Carapresa di Giudice Leo</i>, because the two Gossips might both
lie together in one bed; wherewith divers times she acquainted her
Husband, but by no meanes he would admit it.</p>

<p>At one time among the rest, as she was making the same motion
againe to her Husband, that his friend might be lodged in better
manner: Gossip <i>John</i> thus spake to her. Good <i>Zita Carapresa</i>,
never molest your selfe for me, because I lodge to mine owne contentment,
and so much the rather, in regard that whensoever I list:
I can convert my Mule into a faire young woman, to give mee
much delight in the night-season, and afterward make her a Mule
againe: thus am I never without her company.</p>

<p>The young woman wondring at these words, and beleeving he
did not fable in them: she told them to her Husband, with this addition
beside, <i>Pietro</i> (quoth she) if he be such a deare friend to thee,
as thou hast often avouched to me; with him to instruct thee in so
rare a cunning, that thou maist make a Mule of me; then shalt thou
have both an Asse and a Mule to travell withall about thy businesse,
whereby thy benefit will be double: and when we returne home to
our house; then thou maist make mee thy wife againe, in the same
condition as I was before. Gossip <i>Pietro</i>, who was (indeed) but
a very Coxecombe; beleeved also the words to be true, yeelding
therefore the more gladly to her advise; and moving the matter to
his Gossip <i>John</i>, to teach him such a wonderfull secret, which would
redound so greatly to his benefit: but <i>John</i> began to disswade him
from it, as having spoken it in merriment, yet perceiving, that no
contradiction would serve to prevaile, thus he began.</p>

<p>Seeing you will needs have it so, let us rise to morrow morning
before day, as in our travell we use to doe, and then I will shew you
how it is to be done: onely I must and doe confesse, that the most
difficult thing of all the rest, is, to fasten on the taile, as thou shalt
see.</p>

<p>Gossip <i>Pietro</i> and his wife, could hardly take any rest all the
night long, so desirous they were to have the deed done; and therefore
when it drew towards day, up they arose, and calling Gossip
<i>John</i>, he came presently to them in his shirt, &amp; being in the Chamber
with them, he said. I know not any man in the world, to whom
I would disclose this secret, but to you, and therefore because you
so earnestly desire it, I am the more willing to doe it. Onely you
must consent, to doe whatsoever I say, if you are desirous to have it
done. Faithfully they promised to performe all, whereupon <i>John</i>
delivering a lighted Candle to Gossip <i>Pietro</i>, to hold in his hand,
said. Marke well what I doe, and remember all the words I say: but
be very carefull, that whatsoever thou hearest or seest, thou doe
not speake one word, for then the enchantment will be utterly overthrowne,
onely wish that the taile may be well set on, for therein
consisteth all the cunning.</p>

<p>Gossip <i>Pietro</i> holding the Candle, and the woman being prepared as
<i>John</i> had appointed her, she bowed her selfe forwardes with
her hands set to the ground, even as if she stood upon foure feete.
First with his hands he touched her head and face, saying, Heere is
the goodly head of a Mule: then handling her disheveld haire, termed
them the goodly mane of a Mule. Afterwardes, touching the
body, armes, legs, and feete, gave them all the apt names (for those
parts) belonging to a Mule, nothing else remaining, but onely the
forming of the taile, which when <i>Pietro</i> perceived, how <i>John</i> was
preparing to fasten it on (having no way misliked all his former
proceeding) he called to him, saying: Forbeare Gossippe <i>John</i>, my
Mule shal have no taile at all, I am contented to have her without a
taile. How now Gossip <i>Pietro</i>? answered <i>John</i>, What hast thou
done? Thou hast mard all by this unadvised speaking, even when
the worke was almost fully finished. It is no matter Gossip (answered
<i>Pietro</i>) I can like my Mule better without a taile, then to see it
set on in such manner.</p>

<p>The fond young woman, more covetously addicted to gayne and
commodity, then looking into the knavish intention of her Gossip
<i>John</i>; began to grow greatly offended. Beast as thou art (quoth she
to her Husband) why hast thou overthrowne both thine own good
Fortune and mine? Diddest thou ever see a Mule without a taile?
Wouldst thou have had him made me a monster? Thou art wretchedly
poore, and when we might have bin enriched for ever, by a
secret knowne to none but our selves, thou art the Asse that hast defeated
all, and made thy friend to become thine enemy. Gossippe
<i>John</i> began to pacifie the woman, with solemne protestations of his
still continuing friendship, albeit (afterwards) there was no further
desiring of any more Mule-making: but Gossip <i>Pietro</i> fel to his former
Trading onely with his Asse, as he was no lesse himselfe, and
hee went no more with Gossip <i>John</i> to the Faires in <i>Apuglia</i>, neyther
did he ever request, to have the like peece of service done for
him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although there was much laughing at this Novell, the Ladies
understanding it better, then <i>Dioneus</i> intended that
they should have done, yet himselfe scarsely smiled. But
the Novels being all ended, and the Sunne beginning to loose his
heate; the Queene also knowing, that the full period of her government
was come: dispossessing her selfe of the Crowne, shee placed
it on the head of <i>Pamphilus</i>, who was the last of all to be honoured
with this dignity; wherefore (with a gracious smile) thus she spake
to him.</p>

<p>Sir, it is no meane charge which you are to undergo, in making
amends (perhaps) for all the faults committed by my selfe and the
rest, who have gone before you in the same authority; and, may it
prove as prosperous unto you, as I was willing to create you our
King. <i>Pamphilus</i> having received the honour with a chearfull mind,
thus answered. Madam, your sacred vertues, and those (beside) remaining
in my other Subjects, will (no doubt) worke so effectually
for me, that (as the rest have done) I shall deserve your generall
good opinion. And having given order to the Master of the Houshold
(as all his predecessors had formerly done, for every necessary
occasion) he turned to the Ladies, who expected his gracious favour,
and said.</p>

<p>Bright Beauties, it was the discretion of your late Soveraigne &amp;
Queene, in regard of ease and recreation unto your tyred spirits, to
grant you free liberty, for discoursing on whatsoever your selves
best pleased: wherefore, having enjoyed such a time of rest, I am of
opinion, that it is best to returne once more to our wonted Law, in
which respect, I would have every one to speake in this manner to
morrow. Namely, of those men or women, who have done any
thing bountifully or magnificently, either in matter of amity, or otherwise.
The relation of such worthy arguments, will (doubtlesse)
give an addition to our very best desires, for a free and forward inclination
to good actions, whereby our lives (how short soever they
bee) may perpetuate an ever-living renowne and fame, after our
mortall bodies are converted into dust, which (otherwise) are no
better then those of bruite beasts, reason onely distinguishing this
difference, that as they live to perish utterly, so we respire to reigne
in eternity.</p>

<p>The Theame was exceedingly pleasing to the whole Company;
who being all risen, by permission of the new King, every one fel to
their wonted recreations, as best agreed with their owne disposition;
untill the houre for Supper came, wherein they were served
very sumptuously. But being risen from the Table, they began their
dances, among which, many sweet Sonnets were enterlaced, with
such delicate Tunes as moved admiration. Then the King commanded
Madam <i>Neiphila</i>, to sing a song in his name, or how her selfe
stood best affected. And immediately with a cleare and rare voice,
thus she began.</p>

<p>This Song, most sweetly sung by Madame <i>Neiphila</i>, was especially
commended, both by the King, &amp; all the rest of the Ladies. Which
being fully finished, the King gave order, that everie one should repaire
to their Chambers, because a great part of the night was already
spent.</p>

<h4><i>The end of the Ninth Day.</i></h4>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="The_Tenth_and_last_Day" id="The_Tenth_and_last_Day">The
Tenth and last Day.</a></h2>

<h4><i>Whereon, under the government of Pamphilus,
the severall Arguments do concerne such persons,
as either by way of Liberality, or in Magnificent
manner, performed any worthy action,
for love, favour, friendship, or any other honourable
occasion.</i></h4>


<h4>The Induction.</h4>


<p>Already began certaine small
Clouds in the West, to blush
with a Vermillion tincture,
when those in the East (having
reached to their full heighth)
looked like bright burnished
Gold, by splendour of the Sun
beames drawing neere unto
them: when <i>Pamphilus</i> being risen, caused the Ladies,
and the rest of his honourable companions to be called.
When they were all assembled, and had concluded
together on the place, whither they should walke
for their mornings recreation: the King ledde on the
way before, accompanied with the two Noble Ladies
<i>Philomena</i> and <i>Fiammetta</i>, all the rest following after
them, devising, talking, and answering to divers demands
both what that day was to be don, as also concerning
the proposed imposition.</p>

<p>After they had walked an indifferent space of time,
and found the rayes of the Sunne to be over-piercing
for them: they returned backe againe to the Pallace,
as fearing to have their blood immoderately heated.
Then rinsing their Glasses in the coole cleare running
current, each tooke their mornings draught, &amp;
then walked into the milde shades about the Garden,
untill they should bee summoned to dinner. Which
was no sooner over-past, and such as slept, returned
waking: they mette together againe in their wonted
place, according as the King had appointed, where
he gave command unto Madame <i>Neiphila</i>, that shee
should (for that day) begin the first Novell, which she
humbly accepting, thus began.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a name="A_Florentine_knight_named_Signior_Rogiero_de_Figiovanni_became" id="A_Florentine_knight_named_Signior_Rogiero_de_Figiovanni_became"><i>A Florentine knight, named Signior</i> Rogiero de Figiovanni, <i>became
a servant to</i> Alphonso, <i>King of</i> Spaine, <i>who (in his owne opinion)
seemed but sleightly to respect and reward him. In regard whereof,
by a notable experiment, the King gave him a manifest testimony,
that it was not through any defect in him, but onely occasioned by
the Knights ill fortune; most bountifully recompensing him afterward.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The First Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein may evidently be discerned, that Servants to Princes and great
Lords, are many times recompenced, rather by their good fortune,
then in any regard of their dutifull services.</i></h4>


<p>I doe accept it (Worthy Ladies) as no mean
favour, that the King hath given me the first
place, to speake of such an honourable Argument,
as Bounty and Magnificence is,
which precious Jewell, even as the Sunne
is the beauty, or ornament and bright glory
of al heaven; so is bounty and magnificence
the Crowne of all vertues. I shall then recount
to you a short Novell, sufficiently pleasing, in mine owne opinion,
and I hope (so much I dare rely on your judgements) both
profitable, and worthy to be remembred.</p>

<p>You are to know then, that among other valiant Knights, which
of long have lived in our City, one of them, and (perhappes) of as
great merit as any, was one, named Signior <i>Rogiero d'Figiovanni</i>.
He being rich, of great courage, and perceiving, that (in due consideration)
the quality belonging to life, and the customes observed
among our <i>Tuscanes</i>, were not answerable to his expectation, nor
agreed with the disposition of his valour; determined to leave his
native Countrey, and belong in service (for some time) to <i>Alfonso</i>,
King of <i>Spaine</i>, whose fame was generally noised in all places, for
excelling all other Princes in those times, for respect of mens well
deservings, and bountifull requitall of their paines. Being provided
in honourable order, both of Horses, Armes, &amp; a competent train, he
travelled to <i>Spaine</i>, where he was worthily entertained.</p>

<p>Signior <i>Rogiero</i> continuing there, living in honourable manner, and
performing many admirable actions of arms; in short time he made
himselfe sufficiently knowne, for a very valiant and famous man.
And having remained there an indifferent long while, observing divers
behaviours in the king: he saw, how he enclined himselfe first to
one man, then to another, bestowing on one a Castle, a Towne on
another, and Baronnies on divers, som-what indiscreetly, as giving
away bountifully to men of no merit. And restraining all his favours
from him, as seeming close fisted, and parting with nothing: he took
it as a diminishing of his former reputation, and a great empayring
of his fame, wherefore he resolved on his departure thence, &amp; made
his suit to the king that he might obtaine it. The king did grant it, bestowing
on him one of the very best Mules, and the goodliest that
ever was backt, a gift most highly pleasing to <i>Rogiero</i>, in regarde of
the long journey he intended to ride. Which being deliverd, the king
gave charge to one of his Gentlemen, to compasse such convenient
meanes, as to ride thorow the country, and in the company of Signior
<i>Rogiero</i>, yet in such manner, as he should not perceive, that the
King had purposely sent him so to do. Respectively he should observe
whatsoever he said concerning the king, his gesture, smiles, and
other behaviour, shaping his answers accordingly, and on the nexte
morning to command his returne backe with him to the King.</p>

<p>Nor was the Gentleman slacke in this command, but noting <i>Rogieroes</i>
departing forth of the city, he mounted on horseback likewise,
and immediately after came into his company, making him beleeve,
that he journeyed towards <i>Italy. Rogiero</i> rode on the Mule which the
king had given him, with diversity of speeches passing between them.
About three of the clocke in the afternoone, the Gentleman said. It
were not amisse Sir, (having such fit opportunitie) to Stable our
horses for a while, till the heate be a little more overpast. So taking
an Inne, and the horses being in the stable, they all staled except
the Mule.</p>

<p>Being mounted againe, and riding on further, the Gentleman
duely observed whatsoever <i>Rogiero</i> spake, and comming to the passage
of a small River or Brooke: the rest of the beasts dranke, and
not the Mule, but staled in the River: which Signior <i>Rogiero</i> seeing,
clapping his hands on the Mules mane, hee said. What a wicked
beast art thou? thou art just like thy Master that gave thee to mee.
The Gentleman committed the words to memory, as he did many
other passing from <i>Rogiero</i>, riding along the rest of the day, yet none
in disparagement of the King, but rather highly in his commendation.
And being the next morning mounted on horseback, seeming
to hold on still the way for <i>Tuscane</i>: the Gentleman fulfilled the
Kings command, causing Signior <i>Rogiero</i> to turne back againe with
him, which willingly he yeelded to doe.</p>

<p>When they were come to the Court, and the King made acquainted
with the words, which <i>Rogiero</i> spake to his Mule; he was
called into the presence, where the King shewed him a gracious
countenance, &amp; demanded of him, why he had compared him to his
Mule? Signior <i>Rogiero</i> nothing daunted, but with a bold and constant
spirit, thus answered. Sir, I made the comparison, because, like
as you give, where there is no conveniency, and bestow nothing
where reason requireth: even so, the Mule would not stale where
she should have done, but where was water too much before, there
she did it. Beleeve me Signior <i>Rogiero</i>, replyed the King, if I have
not given you such gifts, as (perhaps) I have done to divers other,
farre inferiour to you in honour and merit; this happened not thorough
any ignorance in me, as not knowing you to be a most valiant
Knight, and well-worthy of speciall respect: but rather through
your owne ill fortune, which would not suffer me to doe it, whereof
she is guilty, and not I, as the truth thereof shall make it selfe apparent
to you. Sir, answered <i>Rogiero</i>, I complaine not, because I
have received no gift from you, as desiring thereby covetously to
become the richer: but in regard you have not as yet any way acknowledged,
what vertue is remaining in me. Neverthelesse, I allow
your excuse for good and reasonable, and am heartely contented,
to behold whatsoever you please; although I doe confidently
credit you, without any other testimony.</p>

<p>The King conducted him then into the great Hall, where (as hee
had before given order) stood two great Chests, fast lockt; &amp; in the
presence of all his Lords, the King thus spake. Signior <i>Rogiero</i>, in
out of these Chests is mine imperiall Crowne, the Scepter Royall,
the Mound, &amp; many more of my richest girdles, rings, plate, &amp; Jewels,
even the very best that are mine: the other is full of earth onely.
Chuse one of these two, and which thou makest election of; upon
my Royall word thou shalt enjoy it. Hereby shalt thou evidently
perceive, who hath bin ingreatful to the deservings, either I, or thine
owne bad fortune. <i>Rogiero</i> seeing it was the kings pleasure to have
it so; chose one of them, which the King caused presently to be opened,
it approving to be the same that was full of earth, whereat
the King smyling, said thus unto him.</p>

<p>You see Signior <i>Rogiero</i>, that what I said concerning your ill fortune,
is very true: but questionlesse, your valour is of such desert,
as I ought to oppose my selfe against all her malevolence. And because
I know right, that you are not minded to become a Spaniard;
I will give you neither Castle nor dwelling place: but I will bestow
the Chest on you (in meer despight of your malicious fortune)
which she so unjustly tooke away from you. Carry it home with
you into your Countrey, that there it may make an apparant testimoney,
in the sight of all your well-willers, both of your owne vertuous
deservings, and my bounty. Signior <i>Rogiero</i> humbly receiving
the Chest, and thanking his Majestie for so liberall a gift, returned
home joyfullly therewith, into his native Countrey of <i>Tuscane</i>.</p>

<h2>The second Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is declared that good men doe sometimes fall into bad conditions,
onely occasioned thereto by necessity: And what meanes are to
be used, for their reducing to goodnesse againe.</i></h4>


<p>The magnificence and Royall bounty, which King <i>Alphonso</i>
bestowed on the Florentine knight, passed through the
whole assembly with no mean applause; &amp; the King (who
gave it the greatest praise of al) commanded Madame <i>Eliza</i>, to take
the second turne in order; whereupon, thus she began.</p>

<p>Faire Ladies, if a king shewed himselfe magnificently minded,
and expressed his liberall bounty to such a man, as had done him
good and honourable services: it can be termed no more then a
vertuous deed well done, and becomming a King. But what will we
say, when we heare that a Prelate of the Church, shewed himselfe
wondrously magnificent, and to such a one as was his enemy: can
any malicious tongue speake ill of him? Undoubtedly, no other
answere is to be made, but the action of the King was meerely vertue,
and that of the Prelate, no lesse then a miracle: for how can it
be otherwise, when they are more greedily covetous then women,
and deadly enemies to all liberality? And although every man
(naturally) desireth revenge for injuries and abuses done unto
him: yet men of the Church, in regard that dayly they preached
patience, and commaund (above all things else) remission of
sinnes: it would appeare a mighty blemish in them, to be more froward
and furious then other men. But I am to speake of a reverend
Prelate of the Church, as also concerning his munificent
bounty, to one that was his enemy, and yet became his reconciled
friend, as you shall perceive by my Novell.</p>

<p><i>Ghinotto di Tacco</i>, for his insolent and stout robberies, became a
man very farre famed, who being banished from <i>Sienna</i>, and an enemy
to the Countes <i>Disanta Fiore</i>: prevailed so by his bold and
headstrong perswasions, that the Towne of <i>Raticonfani</i> rebelled against
the Church of Rome, wherein he remaining; all passengers
whatsoever, travelling any way thereabout, were robde and rifled
by his theeving Companions. At the time whereof now I speake,
<i>Boniface</i> the eight, governed as Pope at Rome, and the Lord Abbot
of <i>Clugni</i> (accounted to be one of the richest Prelates in the world)
came to Rome, and there either by some surfeit, excesse of feeding,
or otherwise, his stomacke being grievously offended and pained;
the Phisitians advised him, to travell to the Bathes at <i>Sienna</i>, where
he should receive immediate cure. In which respect, his departure
being licenced by the Pope, to set onward thither, with great
and pompous Carriages, of Horses, Mules, and a goodly traine, without
hearing any rumour of the theevish Consorts.</p>

<p><i>Ghinotto di Tacco</i>, being advertised of his comming, spred about
his scouts and nettes, and without missing so much as one Page, shut
up the Abbot, with all his traine and baggage, in a place of narrow
restraint, out of which he could by no meanes escape. When this
was done, he sent one of his most sufficient attendants, (well accompanyed)
to the Lord Abbot, who said to him in his Masters
name, that if his Lordship were so pleased, hee might come and visite
<i>Ghinotto</i> at his Castle. Which the Abbot hearing, answered
chollerickly, that he would not come thither, because hee had nothing
to say to <i>Ghinotto</i>: but meant to proceed on in his journey, and
would faine see, who durst presume to hinder his passe. To which
rough words, the messenger thus mildely answered. My Lord
(quoth he) you are arrived in such a place, where we feare no other
force, but the all-controlling power of heaven, clearely exempted
from the Popes thunder-cracks, of maledictions, interdictions, excommunications,
or whatsoever else: and therefore it would bee
much better for you, if you pleased to do as <i>Ghinotto</i> adviseth you.</p>

<p>During the time of this their interparlance, the place was suddenly
round ingirt with strongly armed theeves, and the Lord Abbot
perceiving, that both he and all his followers were surprized: tooke
his way (though very impatiently) towards the Castle, and likewise
all his company and carriages with him. Being dismounted, hee
was conducted (as <i>Ghinotto</i> had appointed) all alone, into a small
Chamber of the Castle, it being very darke and uneasie: but the
rest of his traine, every one according to his ranck and quality, were
all well lodged in the Castle, their horses, goods and all things else,
delivered into secure keeping, without the least touch of injury or
prejudice. All which being orderly done, <i>Ghinotto</i> himselfe went
to the Lord Abbot, and said. My Lord, <i>Ghinotto</i>, to whom you
are a welcome guest, requesteth, that it might be your pleasure to
tell him, whither you are travelling, and upon what occasion?</p>

<p>The Lord Abbot being a very wise man, and his angry distemper
more moderately qualified; revealed whither he went, and the
cause of his going thither. Which when <i>Ghinotto</i> had heard, hee
departed courteously from him, and began to consider with himselfe,
how he might cure the Abbot; yet without any Bathe. So,
commanding a good fire to be kept continually in his small Chamber,
and very good attendance on him: the next morning, he came
to visite him againe, bringing a faire white Napkin on his arme, and
in it two slices or toasts of fine Manchet, a goodly cleare Glasse, full
of the purest white-Bastard of <i>Corniglia</i> (but indeed, of the Abbots
owne provision brought thither with him) and then hee spoke to
him in this manner.</p>

<p>My Lord, when <i>Ghinotto</i> was younger then now he is, he studyed
Physicke, and he commanded me to tell you, that the very best medicine,
he could ever learne, against any disease in the stomacke, was
this which he had provided for your Lordship, as an especiall preparative,
and which he should finde to be very comfortable. The Abbot,
who had a better stomacke to eate, then any will or desire to
talke: although hee did it somewhat disdainfully, yet hee eate up
both the toastes, and roundly dranke off the Glasse of Bastard.
Afterward, divers other speeches passed betweene them, the one
still advising in Phisicall manner, and the other seeming to care little
for it: but moved many questions concerning <i>Ghinotto</i>, and earnestly
requesting to see him. Such speeches as favoured of the Abbots
discontentment, and came from him in passion; were clouded
with courteous acceptance, &amp; not the least signe of any mislike: but
assuring his Lordship, that <i>Ghinotto</i> intended very shortly to see him,
and so they parted for that time.</p>

<p>Nor returned he any more, till the next morning with the like
two toastes of bread, and such another Glasse of white Bastard, as
he had brought him at the first, continuing the same course for divers
dayes after: till the Abbot had eaten (and very hungerly too)
a pretty store of dryed Beanes, which <i>Ghinotto</i> purposely, (yet secretly)
had hidden in the Chamber. Whereupon he demaunded
of him (as seeming to be so enjoyned by his pretended master) in
what temper he found his stomacke now? I should finde my stomacke
well enough (answered the Lord Abbot) if I could get forth
of thy masters fingers, and then have some good food to feed on:
for his medicines have made me so soundly stomackt, that I am ready
to starve with hunger.</p>

<p>When <i>Ghinotto</i> was gone from him, hee then prepared a very
faire Chamber for him, adorning it with the Abbots owne rich
hangings, as also his Plate and other moveables, such as were alwayes
used for his service. A costly dinner he provided likewise,
whereto he invited divers of the Towne, and many of the Abbots
chiefest followers: then going to him againe the next morning, he
said. My Lord, seeing you doe feele your stomacke so well, it is
time you should come forth of the Infirmary. And taking him by
the hand, he brought him into the prepared Chamber, where he left
him with his owne people, and went to give order for the dinners
serving in, that it might be performed in magnificent manner.</p>

<p>The Lord Abbot recreated himselfe a while with his owne
people, to whom he recounted, the course of his life since hee saw
them; and they likewise told him, how kindly they had bin initeated
by <i>Ghinotto</i>. But when dinner time was come, the Lord Abbot
and all his company, were served with Costly viands and excellent
Wines, without <i>Ghinottoes</i> making himselfe knowne to the Abbot:
till after he had beene entertained some few dayes in this order:
into the great Hall of the Castle, <i>Ghinotto</i> caused all the Abbots
goods and furniture to bee brought, and likewise into a spacious
Court, whereon the windowes of the said Court gazed, all his mules
and horses, with their sumpters, even to the very silliest of them,
which being done, <i>Ghinotto</i> went to the Abbot, and demaunded of
him, how he felt his stomacke now, and whether it would serve him
to venter on horsebacke as yet, or no? The Lord Abbot answered,
that he found his stomacke perfectly recovered, his body strong enough
to endure travell, and all things well, so hee were delivered
from <i>Ghinotto</i>.</p>

<p>Hereupon, he brought him into the hall where his furniture was,
as also all his people, &amp; commanding a window to be opned, whereat
he might behold his horses, he said. My Lord, let me plainely
give you to understand, that neither cowardise, or basenesse of
minde, induced <i>Ghinotto di Tacco</i> (which is my selfe) to become a
lurking robber on the high-wayes, an enemy to the Pope, and so
(consequently) to the Romane Court: but onely to save his owne
life and honour, knowing himselfe to be a Gentleman cast out of
his owne house, and having (beside) infinite enemies. But because
you seeme to be a worthy Lord, I will not (although I have cured
your stomacks disease) deale with you as I doe to others, whose
goods (when they fall into my power) I take such part of as I please:
but rather am well contented, that my necessities being considered
by your selfe, you spare me out a proportion of the things you have
heere, answerable to your owne liking. For all are present here before
you, both in this Hall, and in the Court beneath, free from any
spoyle, or the least impairing. Wherefore, give a part, or take
all, if you please, and then depart hence when you will, or abide
heere still, for now you are at your owne free liberty.</p>

<p>The Lord Abbot wondred not a little, that a robber on the high
wayes, should have such a bold and liberall spirit, which appeared
very pleasing to him; and instantly, his former hatred and spleene against
<i>Ghinotto</i>, became converted into cordiall love and kindnes,
so that (imbracing him in his armes) he said. I protest upon my vow
made to Religion, that to win the love of such a man, as I plainely
perceive thee to be: I would undergo far greater injuries, then those
which I have received at thy hands. Accursed be cruell destiny, that
forced thee to so base a kind of life, and did not blesse thee with
a fairer fortune. After he had thus spoken, he left there the greater
part of all his goods, and returned back againe to Rome, with fewer
horses, and a meaner traine.</p>

<p>During these passed accidents, the Pope had received intelligence
of the Lord Abbots surprizall, which was not a little displeasing to
him: but when he saw him returned, he demaunded, what benefit
he received at the Bathes? Whereto the Abbot, merrily smyling,
thus replyed. Holy Father, I met with a most skilfull Physitian neerer
hand, whose experience is beyond the power of the Bathes, for
by him I am very perfectly cured: and so discoursed all at large.
The Pope laughing heartely, and the Abbot continuing on still his
report, moved with an high and magnificent courage, he demaunded
one gracious favour of the Pope: who imagining that he would
request a matter of greater moment, then he did, freely offered to
grant, whatsoever he desired.</p>

<p>Holy Father, answered the Lord Abbot, all the humble suit which
I make to you, is, that you would be pleased to receive into your
grace and favor, <i>Ghinotto di Tacco</i> my Physitian, because among all
the vertuous men, deserving to have especiall account made of them
I never met with any equall to him both in honour and honesty.
Whatsoever injury he did to me, I impute it as a greater in-fortune,
then any way he deserveth to be charged withall. Which wretched
condition of his, if you were pleased to alter, and bestow on
him some better meanes of maintenance, to live like a worthy man,
as he is no lesse: I make no doubt, but (in very short time) hee will
appeare as pleasing to your holinesse, as (in my best judgement) I
thinke him to be.</p>

<p>The Pope, who was of a magnanimious spirit, and one that highly
affected men of vertue, hearing the commendable motion made
by the Abbot; returned answere, that he was as willing to grant it,
as the other desired it, sending Letters of safe conduct for his comming
thither. <i>Ghinotto</i> receiving such assurance from the Court
of Rome, came thither immediately, to the great joy of the Lord
Abbot: and the Pope finding him to be a man of valor and worth,
upon reconciliation, remitted all former errors, creating him knight,
and Lord Prior of the very chiefest Hospitall in Rome. In which
Office he lived long time after, as a loyall servant to the Church,
and an honest thankefull friend to the Lord Abbot of <i>Clugny</i>.</p>

<h2>The third Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Shewing in an excellent and lively demonstration, that any especiall
honourable vertue, persevering and dwelling in a truly noble soule,
cannot be violenced or confounded, by the most politicke attemptes
of malice and envy.</i></h4>


<p>It appeared to the whole assembly, that they had heard a
matter of mervaile, for a Lord Abbot to performe any
magnificent action: but their admiration ceasing in silence,
the King commanded <i>Philostratus</i> to follow next, who forthwith
thus began.</p>

<p>Honourable Ladies, the bounty and magnificence of <i>Alphonso</i>
King of <i>Spaine</i>, was great indeede, and that done by the Lord Abbot
of <i>Clugny</i>, a thing (perhaps) never heard of in any other. But
it will seeme no lesse mervailous to you, when you heare, how one
man, in expression of great liberality to another man, that earnestly
desired to kill him; should bee secretly disposed to give him his
life, which had bin lost, if the other would have taken it, as I purpose
to acquaint you withall, in a short Novell.</p>

<p>Most certaine it is, at least, if Faith may bee given to the report of
certaine <i>Genewayes</i>, and other men resorting to those remote parts,
that in the Country of <i>Cathaya</i>, there lived somtime a Gentleman,
rich beyond comparison, and named <i>Nathan</i>. He having his living
adjoyning to a great common rode-way, whereby men travayled
from the East to the West (as they did the like from the West unto
the East, as having no other means of passage) and being of a bountifull
and chearfull disposition, which he was willing to make knowen
by experience: he summoned together many Master Masons
and Carpenters, and there erected (in a short time) one of the greatest,
goodliest, and most beautifull houses (in manner of a Princes
Pallace) that ever was seene in all those quarters.</p>

<p>With movables and all kinde of furnishment, befitting a house
of such outward apparance, hee caused it to be plentifully stored,
onely to receive, entertaine, and honour all Gentlemen or other Travailers
whatsoever, as had occasion to passe that way, being not unprovided
also of such a number of servants, as might continuallie
give attendance on all commers and goers. Two and fifty severall
gates, standing al way wide open, &amp; over each of them in great golden
charracters was written, <i>Welcome, welcome,</i> and gave free admission
to all commers whatsoever.</p>

<p>In this honourable order (observed as his estated custom) he persevered
so long a while, as not onely the East parts, but also those
in the west, were every where acquainted with his fame &amp; renown.
Being already well stept into yeares, but yet not wearie (therefore)
of his great charge and liberality: it fortuned, that the rumour of his
noble Hospitality, came to the eare of another gallant Gentleman,
named <i>Mithridanes</i>, living in a Countrey not farre off from the other.</p>

<p>This Gentleman, knowing himself no lesse wealthy then <i>Nathan</i>,
and enviously repining at his vertue and liberality, determined in
his mind, to dim and obscure the others bright splendor, by making
himselfe farre more famous. And having built a Palace answerable
to that of <i>Nathans</i>, with like windings of gates, and welcome inscriptions;
he beganne to extend immeasurable courtesies, unto all such
as were disposed to visite him: so that (in a short while) hee grew
very famous in infinite places. It chanced on a day, as <i>Mithridanes</i>
sate all alone within the goodly Court of his Pallace: a poore
woman entred at one of the gates, craving an almes of him, which
she had; and returned in againe at a second gate, comming also to
him, and had a second almes; continuing so still a dozen times; but
at the thirteenth returning, <i>Mithridanes</i> saide to her: Good Woman,
you goe and come very often, and still you are served with
almes. When the old Woman heard these words, she said. O the
liberality of <i>Nathan</i>! How honourable and wonderfull is that? I
have past through two and thirty gates of his Palace, even such as
are here, and at every one I receyved an almes, without any knowledgement
taken of me, either by him, or any of his followers: and
heere I have past but through thirteene gates, and am there both acknowledged
and taken. Fare well to this house, for I never meane
to visit it any more; with which words shee departed thence, and
never after came thither againe.</p>

<p>When <i>Mithridanes</i> had a while pondered on her speeches, hee
waxed much discontented, as taking the words of the olde woman,
to extoll the renowne of <i>Nathan</i>, and darken or ecclipse his glorie,
whereupon he said to himselfe. Wretched man as I am, when shall
I attaine to the height of liberality, and performe such wonders, as
<i>Nathan</i> doth? In seeking to surmount him, I cannot come neere
him in the very meanest. Undoubtedly, I spend all my endeavour
but in vaine, except I rid the world of him, which (seeing his age
will not make an end of him) I must needs do with my own hands.
In which furious and bloody determination (without revealing his
intent to any one) he mounted on horse-backe, with few attendants
in his company, and after three dayes journey, arrived where <i>Nathan</i>
dwelt. He gave order to his men, to make no shew of beeing
his servants, or any way to acknowledge him: but to provide them
selves of convenient lodgings, untill they heard other tydings from
him.</p>

<p>About Evening, and (in this manner) alone by himselfe, neere to
the Palace of <i>Nathan</i>, he met him solitarily walking, not in pompous
apparrell, whereby to bee distinguished from a meaner man:
and, because he knew him not, neyther had heard any relation of
his description, he demanded of him, if he knew where <i>Nathan</i> then
was? <i>Nathan</i>, with a chearfull countenance, thus replyed. Faire
Syr, there is no man in these parts, that knoweth better how to
shew you <i>Nathan</i> then I do; and therefore, if you be so pleased, I
will bring you to him. <i>Mithridanes</i> said, therein he should do him
a great kindnesse: albeit (if it were possible) he would bee neyther
knowne nor seene of <i>Nathan</i>. And that (quoth he) can I also do sufficiently
for you, seeing it is your will to have it so, if you will goe along
with me.</p>

<p>Dismounting from his horse, he walked on with <i>Nathan</i>, diversly
discoursing, untill they came to the Pallace, where one of the servants
taking <i>Mithridanes</i> his horse, <i>Nathan</i> rounded the fellow in
the eare, that he should give warning to all throughout the House,
for revealing to the Gentleman, that he was <i>Nathan</i>; as accordingly
it was performed. No sooner were they within the Pallace, but he
conducted <i>Mithridanes</i> into a goodly chamber, where none (as yet)
had seene him, but such as were appointed to attend on him reverently;
yea, and he did himselfe greatly honour him, as being loth to
leave his company.</p>

<p>While thus <i>Mithridanes</i> conversed with him, he desired to know
(albeit he respected him much for his yeares) what he was. Introth
Sir, answered <i>Nathan</i>, I am one of the meanest servants to <i>Nathan</i>,
and from my child-hood, have made my selfe thus olde in his service:
yet never hath he bestowed any other advancement on mee,
then as you now see; in which respect, howsoever other men may
commend him, yet I have no reason at all to do it. These Words,
gave some hope to <i>Mithridanes</i>, that with a little more counsell, he
might securely put in execution his wicked determination. <i>Nathan</i>
likewise demaunded of him (but in very humble manner) of
whence, and what he was, as also the businesse inviting him thither:
offering him his utmost aide and counsell, in what soever consisted
in his power.</p>

<p><i>Mithridanes</i> sat an indifferent while meditating with his thoughts
before he would returne any answer: but at the last, concluding to
repose confidence in him (in regard of his pretended discontentment)
with many circumstantiall perswasions, first for fidelity, next for constancie,
and lastly for counsell and assistance, he declared to him truly
what he was, the cause of his comming thither, and the reason urging
him thereto. <i>Nathan</i> hearing these words, and the detestable
deliberation of <i>Mithridanes</i>, became quite changed in himself: yet
wisely making no outward appearance thereof, with a bold courage
and setled countenance, thus he replyed.</p>

<p><i>Mithridanes</i>, thy Father was a Noble Gentleman, and (in vertuous
qualities) inferiour to none, from whom (as now I see) thou
desirest not to degenerate, having undertaken so bold &amp; high an enterprise,
I meane, in being liberall and bountifull to all men. I do
greatly commend the envy which thou bearest to the vertue of <i>Nathan</i>:
because if there were many more such men, the world that is
now wretched and miserable, would become good and conformable.
As for the determination which thou hast disclosed to mee, I
have sealed it up secretly in my soule: wherein I can better give thee
counsell, then any especiall helpe or furtherance: and the course
which I would have thee to observe, followeth thus in few words.</p>

<p>This window, which we now looke forth at, sheweth thee a small
wood or thicket of trees, being little more then the quarter of a miles
distance hence; whereto <i>Nathan</i> usually walketh every morning,
and there continueth time long enough: there maist thou very easily
meet him, and do whatsoever thou intended to him. If thou kilst
him, because thou maist with safety returne home unto thine owne
abiding, take not the same way which guided thee thither, but another,
lying on the left hand, &amp; directing speedily out of the wood,
as being not so much haunted as the other, but rather free from all
resort, and surest for visiting thine owne countrey, after such a dismall
deed is done.</p>

<p>When <i>Mithridanes</i> had receyved this instruction, and <i>Nathan</i>
was departed from him, hee secretly gave intelligence to his men,
(who likewise were lodged, as welcome strangers, in the same house)
at what place they should stay for him the next morning. Night being
passed over, and <i>Nathan</i> risen, his heart altred not a jot from his
counsel given to <i>Mithridanes</i>, much lesse changed from anie part
thereof: but all alone by himselfe, walked on to the wood, the place
appointed for his death. <i>Mithridanes</i> also being risen, taking his
Bow &amp; Sword (for other weapons had he none) mounted on hors-backe,
and so came to the wood, where (somewhat farre off) hee espyed
<i>Nathan</i> walking, and no creature with him. Dismounting
from his horse, he had resolved (before he would kill him) not onely
to see, but also to heare him speake: so stepping roughly to him,
and taking hold of the bonnet on his head, his face being then turned
from him, he sayde. Old man, thou must dye. Whereunto
<i>Nathan</i> made no other answer, but thus: Why then (belike) I have
deserved it.</p>

<p>When <i>Mithridanes</i> heard him speake, and looked advisedly on
his face, he knew him immediately to be the same man, that had entertained
him so lovingly, conversed with him so familiarly, and
counselled him so faithfully: all which overcomming his former fury,
his harsh nature became meerly confounded with shame: So
throwing downe his drawne sword, which he held readily prepared
for the deede: he prostrated himselfe at <i>Nathans</i> feet, and in teares,
spake in this manner. Now do I manifestly know (most loving Father)
your admired bounty and liberalitie; considering, with what
industrious providence, you made the meanes for your comming
hither, prodigally to bestow your life on me, which I have no right
unto, although you were so willing to part with it. But those high
and supreame powers, more carefull of my dutie, then I my selfe:
even at the very instant, and when it was most needfull, opened the
eyes of my better understanding, which infernall envy had closed
up before. And therefore, looke how much you have bin forward
to pleasure me; so much the more shame and punishment, I confesse
my heinous transgression hath justly deserved: take therefore on
me (if you please) such revenge, as you thinke (in justice) answerable
to my sin.</p>

<p><i>Nathan</i> lovingly raised <i>Mithridanes</i> from the ground, then kissing
his cheeke, and tenderly embracing him, he said. Sonne, thou
needed not to aske, much lesse to obtaine pardon, for any enterprise
of thine, which thou canst not yet terme to be good or bad: because
thou soughtest not to bereave me of my life, for any hatred thou
barest me, but onely in coveting to be reputed the Woorthier man.
Take then this assurance of me, and beleeve it constantly, that there
is no man living, whom I love and honour, as I do thee: considering
the greatnesse of thy minde, which consisteth not in the heaping
up of money, as wretched and miserable Worldlings make it
their onely felicity; but, contending in bounty to spend what is
thine, didst hold it for no shame to kil me, thereby to make thy selfe
so much the more worthily famous.</p>

<p>Nor is it any matter to be wondred at, in regard that Emperors,
and the greatest Kings, hadde never made such extendure of their
Dominions, and consequently of their renowne, by any other Art,
then killing; yet not one man onely, as thou wouldst have done: but
infinite numbers, burning whole Countries, and making desolate
huge Townes and Cities, onely to enlarge their dominion, and further
spreading of their fame. Wherefore, if for the increasing of thine
owne renowne, thou wast desirous of my death: it is no matter of
novelty, and therefore deserving the lesse mervaile, seeing men are
slaine daily, and all for one purpose or other.</p>

<p><i>Mithridanes</i>, excusing no further his malevolent deliberation,
but rather commending the honest defence, which <i>Nathan</i> made
on his behalfe; proceeded so farre in after discoursing, as to tel him
plainely, that it did wondrously amaze him, how he durst come to
the fatall appointed place, himselfe having so exactly plotted and
contrived his owne death: whereunto <i>Nathan</i> returned this aunswere.</p>

<p>I would not have thee <i>Mithridanes</i>, to wonder at my counsel or
determination; because, since age hath made mee Maister of mine
owne will, and I resolved to doe that, wherein thou hast begun
to follow me: never came any man to mee, whom I did not content
(if I could) in any thing he demanded of mee. It was thy fortune
to come for my life, which when I saw thee so desirous to have
it, I resolved immediately to bestow it on thee: and so much the rather,
because thou shouldst not be the onely man, that ever departed
hence, without enjoying whatsoever hee demanded. And, to
the end thou mightst the more assuredly have it, I gave thee that
advice, least by not enjoying mine, thou shouldest chance to loose
thine owne. I have had the use of it full fourescore yeares, with the
consummation of all my delights and pleasures: and well I know,
that according to the course of Nature (as it fares with other men,
and generally all things else) it cannot bee long before it must leave
mee.</p>

<p>Wherefore, I hold it much better for me to give it away freely,
as I have alwayes done my goods and treasure; then bee curious in
keeping it, and suffer it to be taken from me (whether I will or no)
by Nature. A small gift it is, if time make me up the full summe of
an hundred yeares: how miserable is it then, to stand beholding
but for foure or five, and all of them vexation too? Take it then I intreate
thee, if thou wilt have it; for I never met with any man before
(but thy selfe) that did desire it, nor (perhaps) shall finde any other
to request it: for the longer I keepe it, the worse it wil be esteemed:
and before it grow contemptible, take it I pray thee.</p>

<p><i>Mithridanes</i>, being exceedingly confounded with shame, bashfully
sayde: Fortune fore-fend, that I should take away a thing so
precious as your life is, or once to have so vile a thought of it as lately
I had; but rather then I would diminish one day thereof, I could
wish, that my time might more amply enlarge it. Forthwith aunswered
<i>Nathan</i>, saying. Wouldst thou (if thou couldst) shorten
thine owne dayes, onely to lengthen mine? Why then thou wouldest
have me to do that to thee, which (as yet) I never did unto any
man, namely, robbe thee, to enrich my selfe. I will enstruct thee
in a much better course, if thou wilt be advised by mee. Lusty and
young, as now thou art, thou shalt dwell heere in my house, and be
called by the name of <i>Nathan</i>. Aged, and spent with yeares, as
thou seest I am, I will goe live in thy house, and bee called by the
name of <i>Mithridanes</i>. So, both the name and place shall illustrate
thy Glorie, and I live contentedly, without the very least thought
of envie.</p>

<p>Deare Father, answered <i>Mithridanes</i>, if I knew so well howe to
direct mine owne actions, as you doe, and alwayes have done, I
would gladly accept your most liberall offer: but because I plainlie
perceive, that my very best endeavours, must remayne darkened
by the bright renowne of <i>Nathan</i>: I will never seeke to impayre
that in another, which I cannot (by any means) increase in my selfe,
but (as you have worthily taught me) live contented with my owne
condition.</p>

<p>After these, and many more like loving speeches had passed between
them, according as <i>Nathan</i> very instantly requested, <i>Mithridanes</i>
returned back with him to the Pallace, where many dayes he
highly honoured &amp; respected him, comforting &amp; counselling him, to
persever alwayes in his honourable determination. But in the end,
when <i>Mithridanes</i> could abide there no longer, because necessary
occasions called him home: he departed thence with his men, having
found by good experience, that hee could never goe beyond
<i>Nathan</i> in liberality.</p>

named Madam</i> Catharina, <i>forth of a grave, wherein she
was buried for dead: which act he did, in regard of his former honest
affection to the said Gentlewoman. Madame</i> Catharina <i>remaining
afterward, and delivered of a goodly Sonne: was (by</i> Signior <i>there</i>

<h2>The Fourth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is shewne, That true love hath alwayes bin, and so still is, the
occasion of many great and worthy courtesies.</i></h4>


<p>By judgment of all the honourable assembly, it was reputed wonderfull,
that a man should be so bountifull, as to give away his
owne life, and to his hatefull enemy. In which respect, it passed
with generall affirmation, that <i>Nathan</i> (in the vertue of liberallity)
had exceeded <i>Alphonso</i>, King of <i>Spaine</i>, but (especially) the Abbot of
<i>Clugny</i>. So, after every one had delivered their opinion, the King,
turning himselfe to Madame <i>Lauretta</i>, gave her such a signe, as well
instructed her understanding, that she should be the next in order,
whereto she gladly yeelding, began in this manner.</p>

<p>Youthfull Ladies, the discourses already past, have been so worthy
and magnificent, yea, reaching to such a height of glorious
splendour; as (me thinkes) there remaineth no more matter, for us
that are yet to speake, whereby to enlarge so famous an Argument,
and in such manner as it ought to be: except we lay hold on the
actions of love, wherein is never any want of subject, it is so faire
and spacious a field to walke in. Wherefore, as well in behalfe of
the one, as advancement of the other, whereto our instant age is
most of all inclined: I purpose to acquaint you with a generous
and magnificent act, of an amourous Gentleman, which when it
shall be duely considered on, perhaps will appeare equall to any of
the rest. At least, if it may passe for currant, that men may give away
their treasures, forgive mighty injuries, and lay downe life it selfe,
honour and renowne (which is farre greater) to infinite dangers, only
to attaine any thing esteemed and affected.</p>

<p>Understand then (Gracious hearers) that in <i>Bologna</i>, a very famous
City of <i>Lombardie</i>, there lived sometime a Knight, most highly
respected for his vertues, named Signior <i>Gentile de Carisendi</i>,
who (in his younger dayes) was enamoured of a Gentlewoman, called
Madam <i>Catharina</i>, the Wife of Signior <i>Nicoluccio Caccianimico</i>.
And because during the time of his amourous pursuite, he found
but a sorry enterchange of affection from the Lady; hee went (as
hopelesse of any successe) to be Potestate of <i>Modena</i>, whereto he
was called by place and order.</p>

<p>At the same time, Signior <i>Nicoluccio</i> being absent from <i>Bologna</i>,
and his Lady at a Farme-house of his in the Countrey (about three
miles distant from the City) because she was great with child, and
somewhat neere the time of her teeming: it came to passe, that
some dangerous accident befell her, which was so powerfull in operation,
as no signe of life appeared remained in her, but she was
reputed (even in the judgement of the best Phisitians, whereof she
wanted no attendance) to be verily dead. And because in the opinion
of her parents and neerest kinred, the time for her deliverance
was yet so farre off, as the Infant within her, wanted much of a perfect
creature: they made the lesse mourning; but in the next
Church, as also the vault belonging to her Ancestors, they gave her
buriall very speedily.</p>

<p>Which tydings comming to the hearing of Signior <i>Gentile</i>, by
one that was his endeared friend: Although (while she lived) he
could never be gracious in her favour, yet her so sudden death did
greatly grieve him, whereupon he discoursed in this sort with himselfe.
Deare Madame <i>Catharina</i>, I am not a little sorry for thy
death, although (during thy life-time) I was scarcely worthy of one
kind looke: Yet now being dead, thou canst not prohibite me, but
I may robbe thee of a kisse. No sooner had hee spoke the words,
but it beeing then night, and taking such order, as none might
know of his departure: hee mounted on horse-backe, accompanied
onely with one servant, and stayed no where, till hee
came to the vault where the Lady was buried. Which when
he had opened, with instruments convenient for the purpose, he
descended downe into the vault, and kneeled downe by the Beere
whereon she lay, and in her wearing garments, according to the usuall
manner, with teares trickling mainly downe his cheekes, he bestowed
infinite sweet kisses on her.</p>

<p>But as we commonly see, that mens desires are never contented,
but still will presume on further advantages, especially such as love
entirely: so fared it with <i>Gentile</i>, who being once minded to get
him gone, as satisfied with the oblation of his kisses; would needs
yet step backe againe, saying. Why should I not touch her yvory
breast, the Adamant that drew all desires to adore her? Ah let me
touch it now, for never hereafter can I bee halfe so happy. Overcome
with this alluring appetite, gently he laid his hand upon her
breast, with the like awefull respect, as if she were living, and holding
it so an indifferent while: either he felt, or his imagination so
perswaded him, the heart of the Lady to beate and pant. Casting
off all fond feare, and the warmth of his increasing the motion: his
inward soule assured him, that she was not dead utterly, but had
some small sense of life remaining in her, whereof he would needs
be further informed.</p>

<p>So gently as possible he could, and with the helpe of his man, he
tooke her forth of the monument, &amp; laying her softly on his horse
before him, conveighed her closely to his house in <i>Bologna</i>. Signior
<i>Gentile</i> had a worthy Lady to his Mother, a woman of great wisdome
and vertue, who understanding by her Sonne, how matters
had happened; moved with compassion, and suffering no one in the
house to know what was done, made a good fire, and very excellent
Bathe, which recalled back againe wrong-wandering life. Then
fetching a vehement sigh, opening her eyes, &amp; looking very strangely
about her, she said. Alas! where am I now? whereto the good
old Lady kindly replyed, saying. Comfort your selfe Madame, for
you are in a good place.</p>

<p>Her spirits being in better manner met together, and she still gazing
every way about her, not knowing well where she was, and
seeing Signior <i>Gentile</i> standing before her: he entreated his mother
to tell her by what meanes she came thither; which the good old
Lady did, <i>Gentile</i> himselfe helping to relate the whole history. A
while she grieved and lamented, but afterward gave them most
hearty thankes, humbly requesting, that, in regard of the love he
had formerly borne her, in his house she might finde no other usage,
varying from the honour of her selfe and her Husband, and
when day was come, to be conveighed home to her owne house.
Madame, answered Signior <i>Gentile</i>, whatsoever I sought to gaine
from you in former dayes, I never meane, either here, or any where
else, to motion any more. But seeing it hath been my happy fortune,
to prove the blessed means, of reducing you from death to life:
you shal find no other entertainment here, then as if you were mine
owne Sister. And yet the good deed which I have this night done
for you, doth well deserve some courteous requitall: in which
respect, I would have you not to deny me one favour, which I will
presume to crave of you. Whereto the Lady lovingly replyed,
that she was willing to grant it; provided, it were honest, and in her
power: whereto Signior <i>Gentile</i> thus answered.</p>

<p>Madame, your parents, kindred and friends, and generally all
throughout <i>Bologna</i>, doe verily thinke you to be dead, wherefore
there is not any one, that will make any inquisition after you: in
which regard, the favour I desire from you, is no more but to abide
here secretly with my Mother, untill such time as I returne from
<i>Modena</i>, which shall be very speedily. The occasion why I move
this motion, aymeth at this end, that in presence of the chiefest persons
of our City, I may make a gladsome present of you to your
Husband. The Lady knowing her selfe highly beholding to the
Knight, and the request he made to be very honest: disposed her
selfe to doe as he desired (although she earnestly longed, to glad her
parents and kindred with seeing her alive) and made her promise
him on her faith, to effect it in such manner, as he pleased to appoint
and give her direction.</p>

<p>Scarcely were these words concluded, but she felt the custome
of women to come upon her, with the paines and throwes incident
to childing: wherefore, with helpe of the aged Lady, Mother to
Signior <i>Gentile</i>, it was not long before her deliverance of a goodly
Sonne, which greatly augmented the joy of her and <i>Gentile</i>, who
tooke order, that all things belonging to a Woman in such a case,
were not wanting, but she was as carefully respected, even as if she
had been his owne Wife. Secretly he repaired to <i>Modena</i>, where
having given direction for his place of authority; he returned back
againe to <i>Bologna</i>, and there made preparation for a great and solemne
feast, appointing who should be his invited guests, the very
chiefest persons in <i>Bologna</i>, and (among them) Signior <i>Nicoluccio
Caccianimico</i> the especiall man.</p>

<p>After he was dismounted from horsebacke, and found so good
company attending for him (the Lady also, more faire and healthfull
then ever, and the Infant lively disposed) he sate downe at the Table
with his guests, causing them to be served in most magnificent
manner, with plenty of all delicates that could be devised, and never
before was there such a Joviall feast. About the ending of dinner,
closely he made the Lady acquainted with his further intention,
and likewise in what order every thing should be done, which
being effected, he returned to his company, &amp; used these speeches.</p>

<p>Honourable friends, I remember a discourse sometime made
unto me, concerning the Countrey of <i>Persia</i>, and a kind of custome
there observed, not to be misliked in mine opinion. When any one
intended to honour his friend in effectuall manner, he invited him
home to his house, and there would shew him the thing, which
with greatest love he did respect; were it Wife, Friend, Sonne,
Daughter, or any thing else whatsoever; wherewithall hee spared
not to affirme, that as he shewed him those choyce delights, the like
view he should have of his heart, if with any possibility it could be
done; and the very same custome I meane now to observe here in
our City. You have vouchsafed to honour me with your presence,
at this poore homely dinner of mine, and I will welcome you after
the <i>Persian</i> manner, in shewing you the Jewell, which (above all
things else in the world) I ever have most respectively esteemed.
But before I doe it, I crave your favourable opinions in a doubt,
which I will plainely declare unto you.</p>

<p>If any man having in his house a good and faithfull servant, who
falling into extremity of sickenesse, shall be throwne forth into the
open street, without any care or pitty taken on him; A stranger
chanceth to passe by, and (moved with compassion of his weakenesse)
carryeth him home to his owne house, where using all charitable
diligence, and not sparing any cost, he recovereth the sicke
person to his former health. I now desire to know, if keeping the
said restored person, and imploying him about his owne businesse:
the first Master (by pretending his first right) may lawfully complaine
of the second, and yeeld him backe againe to the first master,
albeit he doe make challenge of him?</p>

<p>All the Gentlemen, after many opinions passing among them,
agreed altogether in one sentence, and gave charge to Signior <i>Nicoluccio
Caccianimico</i>, (because he was an excellent and elegant
speaker) to give answere for them all. First, he commended the custome
observed in <i>Persia</i>, saying, he jumpt in opinion with all the
rest, that the first Master had no right at all to the servant, having
not onely (in such necessity) forsaken him, but also cast him forth into
the comfortlesse street. But for the benefits and mercy extended
to him; it was more then manifest, that the recovered person, was
become justly servant to the second Master, and in detayning him
from the first, hee did not offer him any injury at all. The whole
Company sitting at the Table (being all very wise &amp; worthy men)
gave their verdict likewise with the confession of Signior <i>Nicoluccio
Caccianimico</i>. Which answere did not a little please the Knight;
and so much the rather, because <i>Nicoluccio</i> had pronounced it, affirming
himselfe to be of the same minde.</p>

<p>So, sitting in a pretended musing a while, at length he said. My
honourable guests, it is now more then high time, that I should doe
you such honour, as you have most justly deserved, by performing
the promise made unto you. Then calling two of his servants, he
sent them to Madame <i>Catharina</i> (whom he had caused to adorne
her self in excellent manner) entreating her, that she would be pleased
to grace his guests with her presence. <i>Catharina</i>, having deckt
her child in costly habiliments, layed it in her armes, and came with
the servants into the dyning Hall, and sate down (as the Knight had
appointed) at the upper end of the Table, and then Signior <i>Gentile</i>
spake thus. Behold, worthy Gentlemen, this is the Jewell which I
have most affected, and intend to love none other in the world; be
you my Judges, whether I have just occasion to doe so, or no? The
Gentlemen saluting her with respective reverence, said to the
Knight; that he had great reason to affect her: And viewing her
advisedly, many of them thought her to be the very same woman
(as indeed she was) but that they beleeved her to be dead.</p>

<p>But above all the rest <i>Nicoluccio Caccianimico</i> could never be satisfied
with beholding her; and, enflamed with earnest desire, to
know what she was, could not refraine (seeing the Knight was gone
out of the roome) but demaunded of her, whether she were of <i>Bologna</i>,
or a stranger? when the Lady heard her selfe to be thus questioned, and
by her Husband, it seemed painefull to her, to containe
from answering: Neverthelesse, to perfect the Knights intended
purpose, she sate silent. Others demaunded of her, whether the
sweet Boy were hers, or no; and some questioned, if she were <i>Gentiles</i>
Wife, or no, or else his Kinsewoman; to all which demaunds,
she returned not any answere. But when the Knight came to them
againe, some of them said to him. Sir, this woman is a goodly creature,
but she appeareth to be dumbe, which were great pitty, if it
should be so. Gentlemen (quoth he) it is no small argument of her
vertue, to sit still and silent at this instant. Tell us then (said they) of
whence, and what she is. Therein (quoth he) I will quickely resolve
you, upon your conditionall promise: that none of you do remove
from his place, whatsoever shall be said or done, untill I have fully
delivered my minde. Every one bound himselfe by solemne promise,
to perform what he had appointed, and the Tables being voided,
as also the Carpets laid; then the Knight (sitting downe by the
Lady) thus began.</p>

<p>Worthy Gentlemen, this Lady is that true and faithfull servant,
whereof I moved the question to you, whom I tooke out of the cold
street, where her parents, kindred and friends (making no account at
all of her) threw her forth, as a thing vile and unprofitable. Neverthelesse,
such hath been my care and cost, that I have rescued her
out of deaths griping power; and, in a meere charitable disposition,
which honest affection caused me to beare her; of a body, full
of terror &amp; affrighting (as then she was) I have caused her to become
thus lovely as you see. But because you may more apparantly discerne,
in what manner this occasion happened; I will lay it open to
you in more familiar manner. Then he began the whole history,
from the originall of his unbeseeming affection to her (in regard she
was a worthy mans wife) and consequently, how all had happened
to the instant houre, to the no meane admiration of all the hearers,
adding withall. Now Gentlemen (quoth he) if you varry not from
your former opinion, and especially Signior <i>Nicoluccio Caccianimico</i>:
this Lady (by good right) is mine, and no man else, by any
just title, can lay any claime to her.</p>

<p>All sate silent, without answering one word, as expecting what
he intended further to say: but in the meane while, <i>Nicoluccio</i>, the
parents and kindred, but chiefely the Lady her selfe, appeared as
halfe melted into teares with weeping. But Signior <i>Gentile</i>, starting
up from the Table, taking the Infant in his arme, and leading
the Lady by the hand, going to <i>Nicoluccio</i>, thus spake. Rise Sir, I will
not give thee thy wife, whom both her kindred and thine, threw
forth into the street: but I will bestow this Lady on thee, being my
Gossip, and this sweet Boy my God-sonne, who was (as I am verily
perswaded) begotten by thee, I standing witnesse for him at the
Font of Baptisme, and give him mine owne name <i>Gentile</i>. Let me
entreat thee, that, although she hath lived here in mine house, for the
space of three monethes, she should not be lesse welcome to thee,
then before: for I sweare to thee upon my soule, that my former
affection to her (how unjust soever) was the onely meanes of preserving
her life: and more honestly she could not live, with Father,
Mother, or thy selfe, then she hath done here with mine owne Mother.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, he turned to the Lady, saying. Madame, I
now discharge you of all promises made me, delivering you to your
Husband franke and free: And when he had given him the Lady,
and the child in his armes, he returned to his place, and sate downe
againe. <i>Nicoluccio</i>, with no meane joy and hearty contentment
received both his wife and childe, being before farre from expectation
of such an admirable comfort; returning the Knight infinite
thankes (as all the rest of the Company did the like) who could not
refraine from weeping for meere joy, for such a strange and wonderful
accident: everyone highly commending <i>Gentile</i>, &amp; such also
as chanced to heare thereof. The Lady was welcommed home to
her owne house, with many moneths of Joviall feasting, and as she
passed through the streets, all beheld her with admiration, to be so
happily recovered from her grave. Signior <i>Gentile</i> lived long after,
a loyall friend to <i>Nicoluccio</i> and his Lady, and all that were well-willers
to them.</p>

<p>What thinke you now Ladies? Can you imagine, because a
King gave away his Crowne and Scepter; and an Abbot (without
any cost to himselfe) reconciled a Malefactor to the Pope; and an
old idle-headed man, yeelding to the mercy of his enemy: that all
those actions are comparable to this of Signior <i>Gentile</i>? Youth and
ardent affection, gave him a just and lawfull title, to her who was
free (by imagined death) from Husbands, Parents, and all friends
else, she being so happily wonne into his owne possession. Yet honesty
not onely over-swayed the heate of desire, which in many
men is violent and immoderate: but with a bountifull and liberall
soule, that which he coveted beyond all hopes else, and had within
his owne command; he freely gave away. Beleeve me (bright
Beauties) not any of the other (in a true and unpartiall judgement)
are worthy to be equalled with this, or stiled by the name of magnificent
actions.</p>

<h4><a name="Madame_Dianora_the_Wife_of_Signior_Gilberto_being_immodestly" id="Madame_Dianora_the_Wife_of_Signior_Gilberto_being_immodestly"><i>Madame</i> Dianora, <i>the Wife of Signior</i> Gilberto, <i>being immodestly
affected by Signior</i> Ansaldo, <i>to free herselfe from his tedious importunity,
she appointed him to performe (in her judgement) an act
of impossibility, namely, to give her a Garden, as plentifully stored
with fragrant Flowers in January, as in the flourishing moneth of</i>
May. Ansaldo, <i>by meanes of a bond which he made to a Magitian,
performed her request. Signior</i> Gilberto, <i>the Ladyes Husband,
gave consent, that his Wife should fulfill her promise made to</i>
Ansaldo. <i>Who hearing the bountifull mind of her Husband; released
her of her promise: And the Magitian likewise discharged
Signior</i> Ansaldo, <i>without taking any thing of him.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The fift Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Admonishing all Ladies and Gentlewomen, that are desirous to preserve
their chastity, free from all blemish and taxation: to make no
promise of yeelding to any, under a compact or covenant, how impossible
soever it may seeme to be.</i></h4>


<p>Not any one in all the Company, but extolled the worthy
Act of Signior <i>Gentile</i> to the skies; till the King gave
command to Madame <i>Æmillia</i>, that she should follow
next with her Tale, who boldly stepping up, began in this order.</p>

<p>Gracious Ladies, I thinke there is none heere present among us,
but (with good reason) may maintaine, that Signiour <i>Gentile</i> performed
a magnificent deede: but whosoever saith, it is impossible
to do more; perhaps is ignorant in such actions, as can and may be
done, as I meane to make good unto you, by a Novell not over-long
or tedious.</p>

<p>The Countrey of <i>Fretulium</i>, better knowne by the name of <i>Forum
Julii</i>; although it be subject to much cold, yet it is pleasant, in
regard of many goodly Mountaines, Rivers, and cleare running
Springs, wherewith it is not meanly stored. Within those Territories,
is a City called <i>Udina</i>, where sometime lived a faire and Noble
Lady, named Madame <i>Dianora</i>, Wife to a rich and woorthie
Knight, called Signior <i>Gilberto</i>, a man of very great fame and merite.</p>

<p>This beautifull Lady, beeing very modest and vertuously inclined,
was highly affected by a Noble Baron of those parts, tearmed
by the name of Signior <i>Ansaldo Gradense</i>, a man of very great spirit,
bountifull, active in Armes, and yet very affable and courteous,
which caused him to be the better respected. His love to this Lady
was extraordinary, hardly to bee contained within any moderate
compasse, striving to bee in like manner affected of her: to which
end, she wanted no daily solicitings, Letters, Ambassages and Love-tokens,
all proving to no purpose.</p>

<p>This vertuous Lady, being wearied with his often temptations,
and seeing, that by denying whatsoever he demanded, yet he wold
not give over his suite, but so much the more importunately stil pursued
her: began to bethinke herselfe, how she might best be rid of
him, by imposing some such taske upon him, as should bee impossible
(in her opinion) for him to effect. An olde woman, whom hee
imployed for his continuall messenger to her, as shee came one day
about her ordinary errand, with her she communed in this manner.
Good woman (quoth she) thou hast so often assured me, that Signior
<i>Ansaldo</i> loveth me above all other Women in the world, offering
me wonderfull gifts and presents in his name, which I have alwayes
refused, and so stil wil do, in regard I am not to be woon by
any such allurements: yet if I could be soundly perswaded, that his
affection is answerable to thy peremptory protestations, I shoulde
(perhaps) be the sooner wonne, to listen to his suite in milder manner,
then hitherto I have done. Wherefore, if he wil give me assurance,
to perform such a businesse as I mean to enjoyne him, he shall
the speedier heare better answer from me, and I wil confirme it with
mine oath.</p>

<p>Wonderfully pleased was Mistresse <i>Maquerella</i>, to heare a reply
of such comfortable hope; and therefore desired the Lady, to tel hir
what she wold have done. Listen to me wel (answerd Madam <i>Dianora</i>)
the matter which I would have him to effect for me, is; without
the wals of our City, and during the month of Januarie nexte
ensuing, to provide me a Garden, as fairely furnished with all kind
of fragrant flowers, as the flourishing month of May can yeelde no
better. If he be not able to accomplish this imposition, then I command
him, never hereafter to solicite me any more, either by thee,
or any other whatsoever; for, if he do importune me afterward, as
hitherto I have concealed his secret conspiring, both from my husband,
and all my friends; so will I then lay his dishonest suite open
to the world, that he may receive punishment accordingly, for offering
to wrong a Gentleman in his wife.</p>

<p>When Signior <i>Ansaldo</i> heard her demand, and the offer beside
thereuppon made him (although it seemed no easie matter; but a
thing meerly impossible to be done) he considered advisedly, that
she made this motion to no other end, but onely to bereave him of
all his hope, ever to enjoy what so earnestly hee desired: neverthelesse,
he would not so give it utterly over, but would needs approve
what could be done. Heereupon, hee sent into divers partes of the
world, to find out any one that was able to advise him in this doubtfull
case. In the end, one was brought to him, who beeing well recompenced
for his paines, by the Art of Nigromancie would undertake
to do it. With him Signior <i>Ansaldo</i> covenanted, binding himselfe
to pay a great summe of mony, upon performance of so rare a
deed, awaiting (in hopefull expectation) for the month of Januaries
comming.</p>

<p>It being come, and the weather then in extreamity of cold, every
thing being covered with ice and snow; the Magitian prevailed so
by his Art, that after the Christmas Holy dayes were past, and the
Calends of January entred: in one night, and without the Cittie
Wals, the goodliest Garden of flowers and fruites, was sodainely
sprung up, as (in opinion of such as beheld it) never was the like seen
before. Now Ladies, I think I need not demand the question, whether
Signior <i>Ansaldo</i> were wel pleased, or no, who going to beholde
it, saw it most plenteously stored, with al kind of fruit trees, flowers,
herbes and plants, as no one could be named, that was wanting in
this artificiall garden. And having gathered some pretty store of
them, secretly he sent them to Madam <i>Dianora</i>, inviting hir to come
see her Garden, perfected according to her owne desire, and uppon
view thereof, to confesse the integrity of his love to her; considering
and remembring withall, the promise shee had made him under solemne
oath, that she might be reputed for a woman of her word.</p>

<p>When the Lady beheld the fruites and flowers, and heard many
other thinges re-counted, so wonderfully growing in the same
Garden: she began to repent her rash promise made; yet not withstanding
her repentance, as Women are covetous to see all rarities;
so, accompanied with divers Ladies and Gentlewomen more, she
went to see the Garden; and having commended it with much admiration,
she returned home againe, the most sorrowfull Woman
as ever lived, considering what she had tyed her selfe to, for enjoying
this Garden. So excessive grew her griefe and affliction, that it
could not be so clouded or concealed: but her Husband tooke notice
of it, and would needs understand the occasion thereof. Long
the Lady (in regard of shame and modesty) sate without returning
any answer; but being in the end constrained, she disclosd the whole
History to him.</p>

<p>At the first, Signior <i>Gilberto</i> waxed exceeding angry, but when
he further considered withall, the pure and honest intention of his
Wife; wisely he pacified his former distemper, and saide. <i>Dianora</i>,
it is not the part of a wise and honest woman, to lend an eare to ambassages
of such immodest nature, much lesse to compound or make
agreement for her honesty, with any person, under any condition
whatsoever. Those perswasions which the heart listeneth to, by allurement
of the eare, have greater power then many do imagine, &amp;
nothing is so uneasie or difficult, but in a lovers judgement it appeareth
possible. Ill didst thou therefore first of all to listen, but worse
(afterward) to contract.</p>

<p>But, because I know the purity of thy soule, I wil yeelde (to disoblige
thee of thy promise) as perhaps no wise man else would do:
mooved thereto onely by feare of the Magitian, who seeing Signior
<i>Ansaldo</i> displeased, because thou makest a mockage of him; will
do some such violent wrong to us, as we shal be never able to recover.
Wherefore, I would have thee go to Signior <i>Ansaldo</i>, and if
thou canst (by any meanes) obtaine of him, the safe-keeping of thy
honour, and full discharge of thy promise; it shal be an eternall fame
to thee, and the crowne of a most victorious conquest. But if it must
needs be otherwise, lend him thy body onely for once, but not thy
wil: for actions committed by constraint, wherein the will is no
way guilty, are halfe pardonable by the necessity.</p>

<p>Madame <i>Dianora</i>, hearing her husbands words, wept exceedingly,
and avouched, that shee had not deserved any such especiall
grace of him, and therefore she would rather dye, then doe it. Neverthelesse,
it was the wil of her Husband to have it so, and therefore
(against her wil) she gave consent. The next morning, by the
breake of day, <i>Dianora</i> arose, and attiring her selfe in her very meanest
garments, with two servingmen before her, and a waiting Woman
following, she went to the lodging of Signior <i>Ansaldo</i>, who
hearing that Madam <i>Dianora</i> was come to visite him, greatly mervailed,
and being risen, he called the Magitian to him, saying. Come
go with me, and see what effect will follow upon thine Art. And being
come into her presence, without any base or inordinate appetite,
he did her humble reverence, embracing her honestly, and taking
her into a goodly Chamber, where a faire fire was readilie
prepared, causing her to sit downe by him, he sayde unto her as followeth.</p>

<p>Madam, I humbly intreat you to resolve me, if the affection I have
long time borne you, and yet do stil, deserve any recompence at all:
you would be pleased then to tel me truly, the occasion of your instant
comming hither, and thus attended as you are. <i>Dianora</i>, blushing
with modest shame, and the teares trickling mainly down her
faire cheekes, thus answered. Signior <i>Ansaldo</i>, not for any Love I
beare you, or care of my faithfull promise made to you, but onely
by the command of my husband (who respecting more the paynes
and travels of your inordinate love, then his owne reputation and
honour, or mine;) hath caused me to come hither: and by vertue of
his command, am ready (for once onely) to fulfill your pleasure, but
far from any will or consent in my selfe. If Signior <i>Ansaldo</i> were abashed
at the first, hee began now to be more confounded with admiration,
when he heard the Lady speake in such strange manner: &amp;
being much moved with the liberall command of her husband, he
began to alter his inflamed heate, into most honourable respect and
compassion, returning her this answer.</p>

<p>Most noble Lady, the Gods forbid (if it be so as you have sayd)
that I should (Villain-like) soile the honour of him, that takes such
unusuall compassion of my unchaste appetite. And therefore, you
may remaine heere so long as you please, in no other condition, but
as mine owne naturall borne Sister; and likewise, you may depart
freely when you will: conditionally, that (on my behalfe) you render
such thankes to your husband, as you thinke convenient for his
great bounty towards me, accounting me for ever heereafter, as his
loyall Brother and faithfull servant. <i>Dianora</i> having well observed
his answer, her heart being ready to mount out at her mouth with
joy, said. All the world could never make mee beleeve (considering
your honourable minde and honesty) that it would happen otherwise
to me, then now it hath done; for which noble courtesie, I will
continually remaine obliged to you. So, taking her leave, she returned
home honourably attended to her husband, and relating to him
what had happened, it proved the occasion of begetting intire love
and friendship, betweene himselfe and the Noble Lord <i>Ansaldo</i>.</p>

<p>Now concerning the skilfull Magitian, to whom <i>Ansaldo</i> meant
to give the bountifull recompence agreed on betweene them, hee
having seene the strange liberality, which the husband expressed to
Signior <i>Ansaldo</i>, and that of <i>Ansaldo</i> to the Lady, hee presently
saide. Great <i>Jupiter</i> strike me dead with thunder, having my selfe
seene a husband so liberall of his honour, and you Sir of true noble
kindnesse, if I should not be the like of my recompence: for, perceiving
it to be so worthily imployed, I am well contented that you
shal keepe it. The Noble Lord was modestly ashamed, and strove
(so much as in him lay) that he should take all, or the greater part
thereof: but seeing he laboured meerly in vaine, after the third day
was past, and the Magitian had destroyed the Garden againe, hee
gave him free liberty to depart, quite controlling all fond and
unchaste affection in himselfe, either towards <i>Dianora</i>, or any Lady
else, and living (ever after) as best becommeth any Nobleman
to do.</p>

<p>What say you now Ladies? Shal wee make any account of the
woman wel-neere dead, and the kindnesse growne cold in Signiour
<i>Gentile</i>, by losse of his former hopes, comparing them with the liberality
of Signior <i>Ansaldo</i>, affecting more fervently, then ever the
other did? And being (beyond hope) possessed of the booty, which
(above all things else in the world) he most desired to have, to part
with it meerly in fond compassion? I protest (in my judgement) the
one is no way comparable to the other; that of <i>Gentile</i>, with this last
of Signior <i>Ansaldo</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="Victorious_King_Charles_sirnamed_the_Aged_and_first_of_that_Name" id="Victorious_King_Charles_sirnamed_the_Aged_and_first_of_that_Name"><i>Victorious</i> King Charles, <i>sirnamed the Aged, and first of that Name,
fell in love with a young Maiden, named</i> Genevera, <i>daughter to an
ancient Knight, called Signior</i> Neri degli Uberti. <i>And waxing ashamed
of his amorous folly, caused both</i> Genevera, <i>and her fayre
Sister</i> Isotta, <i>to be joyned in marriage with two Noble Gentlemen;
the one named</i> Signior Maffeo da Palizzi, <i>and the other,</i> Signior
Gulielmo della Magna.</a></h4>

<h2>The Sixt Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Sufficiently declaring, that how mighty soever the power of Love is:
yet a magnanimous and truly generous heart, it can by no meanes
fully conquer.</i></h4>


<p>Who is able to expresse ingeniously, the diversity of opinions,
which hapned among the Ladies, in censuring on the
act of Madame <i>Dianora</i>, and which of them was most liberall,
either Signior <i>Gilberto</i> the Husband, Lord <i>Ansaldo</i> the importunate
suiter, or the Magitian, expecting to bee bountifully rewarded.
Surely, it is a matter beyond my capacity: but after the
King had permitted their disputation a long while, looking on Madam
<i>Fiammetta</i>, he commanded that she should report her Novel
to make an end of their controversie; and she (without any further
delaying) thus began. I did alwaies (Noble Ladies) hold it fit and
decent, that in such an assembly as this of ours is, every one ought
to speake so succinctly and plainly: that the obscure understanding,
concerning the matters spoken of, should have no cause of disputation.
For disputes do much better become the Colledges of Scholars,
then to be among us, who hardly can manage our Distaves or
Samplers. And therefore I, doe intend to relate something, which
(peradventure) might appeare doubtfull: will forbeare (seeing you
in such a difference; for that which hath bin spoken alreadie) to use
any difficult discourse; but will speake of one, a man of no meane
ranke or quality, being both a valiant and vertuous King, and what
he did, without any impeach or blemish to his honour.</p>

<p>I make no doubt, but you have often heard report, of king <i>Charles</i>
the Aged, and first of that name, by reason of his magnificent enterprises,
as also his most glorious victory, which he obtaind against
King <i>Manfred</i>, when the <i>Ghibellines</i> were expulsed foorth of <i>Florence</i>,
and the <i>Guelphes</i> returned thither againe. By which occasion,
an ancient knight, named Signior <i>Neri degli Uberti</i>; forsaking
then the City, with all his family and great store of wealth, woulde
live under any other obedience, then the awful power or command
of King <i>Charles</i>. And coveting to be in some solitary place, where
he might finish the remainder of his dayes in peace, he went to <i>Castello
da Mare</i>; where, about a Bow shoote distance from all other
dwelling houses, hee bought a parcel of ground, plentifully stored
with variety of Trees, bearing Olives, Chesnuts, Orenges, Lemons,
Pomcitrons, and other excellent frutages, wherewith the Countrey
flourisheth abundantly. There he built a very faire and commodious
house, and planted (close by it) a pleasant Garden, in the midst
whereof, because he had great plenty of water: according as other
men use to do, being in the like case so wel provided; he made a very
goodly Pond, which forthwith had all kinde of Fish swimming
in it, it being his daily care and endevour, to tend his Garden, and
encrease his Fish-pond.</p>

<p>It fortuned, that King <i>Charles</i> (in the Summer time) for his pleasure
and recreation, went to repose himselfe (for some certayne
dayes) at <i>Castello de Mare</i>, where having heard report of the beautie
and singularitie of Signiour <i>Neries</i> Garden; hee grew very desirous
to see it. But when he understoode to whome it belonged,
then he entred into consideration with himselfe, that hee was an ancient
Knight, maintaining a contrarie faction to his: wherefore, he
thought it fit to goe in some familiar manner, and with no trayne
attending on him. Whereupon he sent him word, that he wold come
to visit him, with foure Gentlemen onely in his companie, meaning
to sup with him in his Garden the next night ensuing. The newes
was very welcome to <i>Signior Neri</i>, who took order in costly manner
for all things to bee done, entertaining the King most joyfullly into
his beautifull Garden.</p>

<p>When the King had survayed all, and the house likewise, he commended
it beyond all other comparison, and the Tables being placed
by the Ponds side, he washed his hands therein, &amp; then sat down
at the table, commanding the Count, Sir <i>Guy de Montforte</i> (who
was one of them which came in his company) to sitte downe by
him, and Signior <i>Neri</i> on his other side. As for the other three of
the traine, hee commaunded them to attend on his service, as Signior
<i>Neri</i> had given order. There wanted no exquisite Viandes
and excellent Wines, all performed in most decent manner, and
without the least noise or disturbance, wherein the King tooke no
little delight.</p>

<p>Feeding thus in this contented manner, and facying the solitude
of the place: sodainly entred into the garden, two young Damosels,
each aged about some fifteene yeares, their haire resembling wyars
of Gold, and curiously curled, having Chaplets (made like provinciall
Crownes) on their heades, and their delicate faces, expressing
them to be rather Angels, then mortall creatures, such was the appearance
of their admired beauty. Their under-garments were of
costly Silke, yet white as the finest snow, framed (from the girdle
upward) close to their bodies, but spreading largely downward, like
the extendure of a Pavillion, and so descending to the feet. She that
first came in sight, caried on her shoulder a couple of fishing Netts,
which she held fast with her left hand, and in the right she carryed a
long staffe. The other following her, had on her left shoulder a Frying-pan,
and under the same arme a small Faggot of woodde, with a
Trevit in her hand; and in the other hand a pot of Oyle, as also a
brand of fire flaming.</p>

<p>No sooner did the King behold them, but he greatly wondered
what they should be; and, without uttering one word, attended to
listen what they wold say. Both the young damosels, when they were
come before the King, with modest and bashfull gesture, they performed
very humble reverence to him, and going to the place of entrance
into the Pond, she who held the Trevit, set it downe on the
ground, with the other things also; and taking the staffe which the
other Damosell carried: they both went into the Pond, the water
whereof reached so high as to their bosomes. One of the Servants
to Signior <i>Neri</i>, presently kindled the fire, setting the Trevit over
it, and putting Oyle into the Frying-panne, held it uppon the Trevit,
awaiting untill the Damosels should cast him uppe Fish. One
of them did beate a place with the staffe, where she was assured of
the Fishes resort, and the other hadde lodged the Nets so conveniently,
as they quickly caught great store of Fish, to the Kings high
contentment, who observed their behaviour very respectively.</p>

<p>As the Fishes were throwne up to the servant, alive as they were,
he tooke the best and fairest of them, and brought them to the
Table, where they skipt and mounted before the King, Count <i>Guy
de Montfort</i> and the Father: some leaping from the Table into the
Pond againe, and others, the King (in a pleasing humour) voluntarily
threw backe to the Damosels. Jesting and sporting in this manner,
till the servant had drest divers of them in exquisite order, and
served them to the Table, according as Signior <i>Neri</i> had ordained.
When the Damosels saw the Fishes service performed, and perceived
that they had fished sufficiently: they came forth of the water,
their garments then (being wet) hanging close about them, even as
if they hid no part of their bodies. Each having taken those things
againe, which at first they brought with them, and saluting the king
in like humility as they did before, returned home to the mansion
house.</p>

<p>The King and Count likewise, as also the other attending Gentlemen,
having duely considered the behaviour of the Damosels: commended
extraordinarily their beauty and faire feature, with those
other perfections of Nature so gloriously shining in them. But (beyond
all the rest) the King was boundlesse in his praises given of
them, having observed their going into the water, the equall carriage
there of them both, their comming forth, and gracious demeanor
at their departing (yet neither knowing of whence, or what they
were) he felt his affection very violently flamed, and grew into such
an amourous desire to them both, not knowing which of them
pleased him most, they so choisely resembled one another in all
things.</p>

<p>But after he had dwelt long enough upon these thoughts, he turned
him selfe to Signior <i>Neri</i>, and demanded of him, what Damosels
they were. Sir (answered <i>Neri</i>) they are my Daughters, both
brought into the world at one birth, and Twinnes, the one
being named <i>Genevera</i> the faire, and the other <i>Isotta</i> the amiable.
The King began againe to commend them both, and gave him advise
to get them both married: wherein he excused himselfe, alleadging,
that he wanted power to doe it. At the same time instant,
no other service remaining to be brought to the table, except Fruit
and Cheese, the two Damosels returned againe, attyred in goodly
Roabes of Carnation Sattin, formed after the Turkish fashion, carrying
two fayre Silver dishes in their hands, filled with divers delicate
Fruits, such as the season then afforded, setting them on the
Table before the King. Which being done, they retyred a little
backeward, and with sweet melodious voyces, sung a ditty, beginning
in this manner.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><i>
<span class="i0">Where Love presumeth into place:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let no one sing in Loves disgrace.<br /></span>
</i></div></div>

<p>So sweet and pleasing seemed the Song to the King (who tooke
no small delight, both to heare and behold the Damosels) even as if
all the Hirarchies of Angels, were descended from the Heavens to
sing before him. No sooner was the Song ended, but (humbly on
their knees) they craved favour of the King for their departing.
Now, although their departure was greatly grieving to him, yet (in
outward appearance) he seemed willing to grant it.</p>

<p>When Supper was concluded, and the King and his Company
remounted on horsebacke: thankefully departing from Signior
<i>Neri</i>, the King returned to his lodging, concealing there closely his
affection to himselfe, and whatsoever important affaires happened:
yet he could not forget the beauty, &amp; gracious behaviour of <i>Genevera</i>
the faire (for whose sake he loved her Sister likewise) but became
so linked to her in vehement manner, as he had no power to think on
any thing else. Pretending other urgent occasions, he fell into
great familiarity with Signior <i>Neri</i>, visiting very often his goodly
Garden; onely to see his faire Daughter <i>Genevera</i>, the Adamant
which drew him thither.</p>

<p>When he felt his amourous assaults, to exceed all power of longer
sufferance: he resolved determinately with himselfe, (being
unprovided of any better meanes) to take her away from her Father,
and not onely she, but her Sister also; discovering both his
love and intent to Count <i>Guy de Montforte</i>, who being a very worthy
and vertuous Lord, and meet to be a Counseller for a King, delivered
his mind in this manner.</p>

<p>Gracious Lord, I wonder not a little at your speeches, and so
much the greater is my admiration, because no man else can be subject
to the like, in regard I have knowne you from the time of your infancy;
even to this instant houre, and alwayes your carriage to bee
one and the same. I could never perceive in your youthfull dayes
(when love should have the greatest meanes to assaile you) any such
oppressing passions: which is now the more novell and strange to
me, to heare it but said, that you being old, and called the Aged;
should be growne amorous, surely to me it seemeth a miracle. And
if it appertained to me to reprehend you in this case, I know well enough
what I could say. Considering, you have yet your Armour
on your backe, in a Kingdome newly conquered, among a Nation
not knowne to you, full of falsehoods, breaches, and treasons; all
which are no meane motives to care and needfull respect. But having
now wone a little leisure, to rest your selfe a while from such
serious affaires; can you give way to the idle suggestions of Love?
Beleeve me Sir, it is no act becomming a magnanimious King; but
rather the giddy folly of a young braine.</p>

<p>Moreover you say (which most of all I mislike) that you intend
to take the two Virgines from the Knight, who hath given you entertainment
in his house beyond his ability, and to testifie how
much he honoured you, he suffered you to have a sight of them,
meerely (almost) in a naked manner: witnessing thereby, what constant
faith he reposed in you, beleeving verily, that you were a just
King, and not a ravenous Woolfe. Have you so soone forgot, that
the rapes and violent actions, done by King <i>Manfred</i> to harmelesse
Ladies, made your onely way of entrance into this Kingdome?
What treason was ever committed, more worthy of eternall punishment,
then this will be in you: to take away from him (who
hath so highly honoured you) his chiefest hope and consolation?
What will be said by all men, if you doe it?</p>

<p>Peradventure you thinke, it will be a sufficient excuse for you, to
say: I did it, in regard hee was a <i>Ghibelline</i>. Can you imagine this
to be justice in a King, that such as get into their possession in this
manner (whatsoever it be) ought to use it in this sort? Let me tell
you Sir, it was a most worthy victory for you, to conquer King
<i>Manfred</i>: but it is farre more famous victory, for a man to conquer
himselfe. You therfore, who are ordained to correct vices in
other men, learne first to subdue them in your selfe, and (by brideling
this inordinate appetite) set not a foule blemish on so faire a
fame, as will be honour to you to preserve spotlesse.</p>

<p>These words pierced the heart of the King deepely, and so
much the more afflicted him, because he knew them to be most
true: wherefore, after he had ventred a very vehement sigh, thus he
replyed. Beleeve me noble Count, there is not any enemy, how
strong soever he be, but I hold him weake and easie to be vanquished,
by him who is skilfull in the warre, where a man may learne to
conquere his owne appetite. But because he shall find it a laborious
taske, requiring inestimable strength and courage: your words
have so toucht me to the quicke, that it becommeth me to let you
effectually perceive (and within the compasse of few dayes) that as
I have learned to conquer others, so I am not ignorant, in expressing
the like power upon my selfe.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, within some few dayes after, the King being
returned to <i>Naples</i>, he determined, as well to free himself from
any the like ensuing follie, as also to recompence Signior <i>Neri</i>, for
the great kindnesse he had shewne to him (although it was a difficult
thing, to let another enjoy, what he rather desired for himselfe)
to have the two Damosels married, not as the Daughters of Signior
<i>Neri</i>, but even as if they were his owne. And by consent of the
Father, he gave <i>Genevera</i> the faire, to Signior <i>Maffeo da Pallizzi</i>,
and <i>Isotta</i> the amiable, to Signior <i>Gulielmo della Magna</i>, two Noble
Knights and honourable Barons. After he had thus given them in
marriage, in sad mourning he departed thence into <i>Apuglia</i>, where
by following worthy and honourable actions, he so well overcame
all inordinate appetites: that shaking off the enthralling fetters of
love, he lived free from all passions, the rest of his life time, and dyed
as an honourable King.</p>

<p>Some perhaps will say, it was a small matter for a King, to give away
two Damosels in marriage, and I confesse it: but I maintaine
it to be great, and more then great, if we say, that a King, being so
earnestly enamoured as this King was; should give her away to
another, whom he so dearely affected himselfe, without receiving
(in recompence of his affection) so much as a leaffe, flower, or the
least fruit of love. Yet such was the vertue of this magnificent
King, expressed in so highly recompencing the noble Knights courtesie,
honouring the two daughters so royally, and conquering his
owne affections so vertuously.</p>

in an extreame and long sickenesse. By her owne devise, and means
of a Song, sung in the hearing of the King: he vouchsafed to visite
her, and giving her a kisse, terming himselfe also to bee her Knight
for ever after, hee honourably bestowed her in marriage on a young
Gentleman, who was called</i> Perdicano, <i>and gave him liberall endowments
with her.</i></a></h4>

<h2>The Seventh Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Wherein is covertly given to understand, that howsoever a Prince
may make use of his absolute power and authority, towards Maides
or Wives that are his Subjects: yet he ought to deny and reject all
things, as shall make him forgetfull of himselfe, and his true honour.</i></h4>


<p>Madame <i>Fiammetta</i> being come to the end of her Novell,
and the great magnificence of King <i>Charles</i> much commended
(howbeit, some of the Company, affecting the
<i>Ghibelline</i> faction, were otherwise minded) Madame <i>Pampinea</i>, by
order given from the King, began in this manner.</p>

<p>There is no man of good understanding (honourable Ladies) but
will maintaine what you have said of victorious <i>Charles</i>; except
such as cannot wish well to any. But because my memory hath
instantly informed me, of an action (perhaps) no lesse commendable
then this, done by an enemy of the said King <i>Charles</i>, and to a
young Maiden of our City; I am the more willing to relate it, upon
your gentle attention vouchsafed, as hitherto it hath been courteously
granted.</p>

<p>At such time as the French were driven out of <i>Sicilie</i>, there
dwelt at <i>Palermo</i> a <i>Florentine</i> Apothecary, named <i>Bernardo Puccino</i>,
a man of good wealth and reputation, who had by his Wife
one onely Daughter, of marriageable yeares, and very beautifull.
<i>Piero</i>, King of <i>Arragon</i>, being then become Lord of that Kingdom,
he made an admirable Feast Royall at <i>Palermo</i>, accompanyed with
his Lords and Barons. In honour of which publique Feast, the
King kept a triumphall day (of Justs and Turnament) at <i>Catalana</i>,
and whereat it chanced, that the Daughter of <i>Bernardo</i>, named <i>Lisana</i>,
was present. Being in a window, accompanied with other
Gentlewomen, she saw the King runne at the Tilt, who seemed so
goodly a person in her eye; that being never satisfied with beholding
him, she grew enamoured, and fell into extremity of affection
towards him.</p>

<p>When the Feastivall was ended, she dwelling in the house of her
Father, it was impossible for her to thinke on any thing else, but
onely the love, which she had fixed on a person of such height.
And that which most tormented her in this case, was the knowledge
of her owne condition, being but meane and humble in degree;
whereby she confessed, that she could not hope for any successefull
issue of her proud love. Neverthelesse, she would not refraine
from affecting the King, who taking no note of this kindnesse
in her, by any perceivable meanes; must needs be the more
regardles, which procured (by wary observation) her afflictions to
be the greater and intollerable.</p>

<p>Whereon it came to passe, that this earnest love encreasing in
her more and more, and one melancholly conceit taking hold on
another: the faire Maide, when she could beare the burden of her
griefe no longer; fell into a languishing sickenesse, consuming away
daily (by evident appearance) even as the Snow melteth by
the warme beames of the Sunne.</p>

<p>The Father and Mother, much dismayed and displeased at
this haplesse accident, applying her with continuall comforts, Phisicke,
and the best skill remayning in all the Phisitions, sought all
possible meanes wayes to give her succour: but all proved to no effect,
because in regard of her choyce (which could sort to none
other then a desperate end) she was desirous to live no longer. Now
it fortuned, that her parents offering her whatsoever remained in
their power to performe, a sudden apprehension entred her minde,
to wit, that (if it might possible be done) before she dyed, she would
first have the King to know, in what manner she stood affected to
him. Wherefore, one day she entreated her Father, that a Gentleman,
named <i>Manutio de Arezza</i>, might be permitted to come see
her. This <i>Manutio</i> was (in those times) held to be a most excellent
Musitian, both for his voyce in singing, and exquisite skill in playing
on Instruments, for which he was highly in favour with King
<i>Piero</i>, who made (almost) daily use of him, to heare him both sing
and play.</p>

<p>Her tender and loving father conceived immediately, that shee
was desirous to heare his playing and singing, both being comfortable
to a body in a languishing sickenesse, whereupon, he sent presently
for the Gentleman, who came accordingly, and after he had
comforted <i>Lisana</i> with kind and courteous speeches; he played
dexteriously on his Lute, which purposely hee had brought with
him, and likewise he sung divers excellent Ditties, which insted of
his intended consolation to the Maid, did nothing else but encrease
her fire and flame.</p>

<p>Afterward, she requested to have some conference with <i>Manutio</i>
alone, and every one being gone forth of the Chamber, she
spake unto him in this manner.</p>

<p><i>Manutio</i>, I have made choyce of thee, to be the faithfull Guardian
of an especiall secret, hoping first of al, that thou wilt never reveale it
to any living body, but onely to him whom I shall bid thee: And
next, to helpe me so much as possibly thou canst, because my onely
hope relyeth in thee. Know then my dearest friend <i>Manutio</i>, that
on the solemne festivall day, when our Soveraigne Lord the King
honoured his exaltation, with the noble exercises of Tilt and Turney;
his brave behaviour kindled such a sparke in my soule, as since
brake forth into a violent flame, and brought me to this weake condition
as now thou seest. But knowing and confessing, how farre
unbeseeming my love is, to aime so ambitiously at a King, and being
unable to controule it, or in the least manner to diminish it:
I have made choyce of the onely and best remedy of all, namely,
to dye, and so I am most willing to doe.</p>

<p>True it is, that I shall travaile in this my latest journey, with endlesse
torment and affliction of soule, except he have some understanding
thereof before, and not knowing by whom to give him intelligence,
in so oft and convenient order, as by thee: I doe therefore
commit this last office of a friend to thy trust, desiring thee, not
to refuse me in the performance thereof. And when thou hast
done it, to let me understand what he saith, that I may dye the
more contentedly, and disburdened of so heavy an oppression, the
onely comfort to a parting spirit: and so she ceased, her teares flowing
forth abundantly.</p>

<p><i>Manutio</i> did not a little wonder at the Maides great spirit, and
her desperate resolution, which moved him to exceeding commiseration,
and suddenly he conceived, that honestly he might discharge
this duty for her, whereupon, he returned her this answer.
<i>Lisana</i>, here I engage my faith to thee, that thou shalt find me firme
and constant, and die I will, rather then deceive thee. Greatly I doe
commend thy high attempt, in fixing thy affection on so Potent
a King, wherein I offer thee my utmost assistance: and I make no
doubt (if thou wouldest be of good comfort) to deale in such sort,
as, before three dayes are fully past, to bring such newes as will content
thee, and because I am loath to loose the least time, I will goe about
it presently. <i>Lisana</i> the young Maiden, once againe entreated
his care and diligence, promising to comfort her selfe so well as she
could, commending him to his good fortune. When <i>Manutio</i> was
gone from her, hee went to a Gentleman, named <i>Mico de
Sienna</i>, one of the best Poets in the composing of verses, as all those
parts yeelded not the like. At his request, <i>Mico</i> made for him this
ensuing Dittie.</p>

<p>The lines contained in this Ditty, <i>Manutio</i> fitted with noates so
mooving and singularly musicall, that every word had the sensible
motion of life in it, where the King being (as yet) not risen from the
Table, he commanded him to use both his Lute and voyce.</p>

<p>This seemed a happy opportunity to <i>Manutio</i>, to sing the dittie
so purposely done and devised: which hee delivered in such excellent
manner, the voice and Instrument concording so extraordinary
pleasing; that all the persons then in the Presence, seemed rather
Statues, then living men, so strangely they were wrapt with admiration,
and the King himselfe farre beyond all the rest, transported
with a rare kinde of alteration.</p>

<p>When <i>Manutio</i> had ended the Song, the King demanded of him,
whence this Song came, because he had never heard it before? My
gracious Lord, answered <i>Manutio</i>, it must needes seeme straunge to
your Majesty, because it is not fully three dayes, since it was invented,
made, and set to the note. Then the King asked, whom it concerned?
Sir (quoth <i>Manutio</i>) I dare not disclose that to any but
onely your selfe. Which answer made the King much more desirous,
and being risen from the Table, he tooke him into his Bed-chamber,
where <i>Manutio</i> related all at large to him, according to
the trust reposed in him. Wherewith the King was wonderfully
well pleased, greatly commending the courage of the Maide, and
said, that a Virgin of such a valiant spirit, did well deserve to have
her case commiserated: and commanded him also, to goe (as sent
from him) and comfort her, with promise, that the very same day, in
the evening, he would not faile to come and see her.</p>

<p><i>Manutio</i>, more then contented, to carry such glad tydings to <i>Lisana</i>;
without staying in any place, and taking his Lute also with
him, went to the Apothecaries house, where speaking alone with
the Maide: he told her what he had done, and afterward sung the
song to her, in as excellent manner as he had done before, wherein
<i>Lisana</i> conceived such joy and contentment, as even in the very
same moment, it was observed by apparant signes, that the violence
of her fits forsooke her, and health began to get the upper hand of
them. So, without suffering any one in the house to know it, or by
the least meanes to suspect it; she comforted her selfe till the evening,
in expectation of her Soveraignes arrivall.</p>

<p><i>Piero</i> being a Prince, of most liberall and benigne nature, having
afterward divers times considered on the matters which <i>Manutio</i>
had revealed to him, knowing also the young Maiden, to bee both
beautifull and vertuous: was so much moved with pitty of her extremitie,
as mounting on horse-backe in the evening, and seeming
as if he rode abroad for his private recreation; he went directly to
the Apothecaries house, where desiring to see a goodly garden, appertaining
then to the Apothecarie, he dismounted from his horse.
Walking into the garden, he began to question with <i>Bernardo</i>, demaunding
him for his Daughter, and whether he had (as yet) marryed
her, or no? My Gracious Lord, answered <i>Bernardo</i>, as yet shee
is not marryed, neither likely to bee, in regard shee hath had a long
and tedious sickenesse: but since Dinner time, she is indifferently
eased of her former violent paine, which we could not discerne the
like alteration in her, a long while before.</p>

<p>The King understood immediately, the reason of this so sudden
alteration, and said. In good faith <i>Bernardo</i>, the world would sustaine
a great maine &amp; imperfection, by the losse of thy faire daughter;
wherefore, we will goe our selfe in person to visite her. So, with
two of his Lords onely, and the Father, he ascended to the Maides
Chamber &amp; being entred, he went to the Beds side, where she sate,
somewhat raised, in expectation of his comming, and taking her by
the hand, he said. Faire <i>Lisana</i>, how commeth this to passe? You being
so faire a Virgin, young, and in the delicacy of your daies, which
should be the chiefest comfort to you, will you suffer your selfe to
be over-awed with sickenesse? Let us intreat you, that (for our sake)
you will be of good comfort, and thereby recover your health the
sooner, especially, when it is requested by a King, who is sorry to see
so bright a beauty sicke, and would helpe it, if it consisted in his
power.</p>

<p><i>Lisana</i>, feeling the touch of his hand, whom she loved above all
things else in the world, although a bashfull blush mounted up into
her cheekes: yet her heart was seazed with such a rapture of pleasure,
that she thought her selfe translated into Paradise, and, so well
as she could, thus she replyed. Great King, by opposing my feeble
strength, against a burden of over-ponderous weight, it became the
occasion of this grievous sickenesse: but I hope that the violence
thereof is (almost) already kild, onely by this soveraigne mercy in
you; and doubtlesse it will cause my speedy deliverance. The King
did best understand this so well palliated answere of <i>Lisana</i>, which
as he did much commend, in regard of her high adventuring; so
he did againe as greatly condemne Fortune, for not making her
more happy in her birth.</p>

<p>So, after he had stayed there a good while, and given her many
comfortable speeches, he returned backe to the Court. This humanity
in the King, was reputed a great honour to the Apothecary
and his daughter, who (in her owne mind) received as much joy and
contentment thereby, as ever any wife could have of her owne
Husband.</p>

<p>And being assisted by better hopes, within a short while after,
she became recovered, and farre more beautifull (in common judgment)
then ever she was before.</p>

<p><i>Lisana</i> being now in perfect health, the King consulted with his
Queene, what meete recompence he should gratifie her withall,
for loving and affecting him in such fervent manner. Upon a day
determined, the King mounting on horsebacke, accompanied with
many of his cheefest Lords and Barons, he rode to the Apothecaries
house, where walking in his beautifull Garden, hee called for
<i>Bernardo</i> and his daughter <i>Lisana</i>. In the meane space, the Queene
also came thither, Royally attended on by her Ladies, and <i>Lisana</i>
being admitted into their company, they expressed themselves very
gracious to her. Soone after, the King and the Queene cald <i>Lisana</i>,
and the King spake in this manner to her.</p>

<p>Faire Virgin, the extraordinary love which you bare to us, calleth
for as great honour from us to you; in which respect, it is our
Royall desire, by one meanes or other to requite your kinde Love.
In our opinion, the chiefe honour we can extend to you, is, that being
of sufficient yeares for marriage, you would grace us so much,
as to accept him for your Husband, whom we intend to bestow on
you. Beside this further grant from us, that (notwithstanding whatsoever
else) you shall call us your Knight; without coveting any
thing else from you, for so great favour, but only one kisse, and
thinke not to bestow it nicely on a King, but grant it the rather, because
he begges it.</p>

<p><i>Lisana</i>, whose lookes, were dyed with a vermillian tincture, or
rather converted into a pure maiden blush, reputing the Kings desire
to be her owne; in a low and humbled voyce, thus answered.
My Lord, most certaine am I, that if it had beene publikely knowne,
how none but your highnes, might serve for me to fixe my love on,
I should have been termed the foole of all fooles: they perhaps beleeving,
that I was forgetfull of my selfe, in being ignorant of mine
owne condition, and much lesse of yours. But the Gods are my witnesses
(because they know the secrets of all hearts) that even in the
very instant, when Loves fire tooke hold on my yeelding affection:
I knew you to be a King, and my selfe the daughter of poore <i>Bernardo</i>
the Apothecary: likewise, how farre unfitting it was for me, to
be so ambitious in my loves presuming. But I am sure your Majestie
doth know (much better then I am able to expresse) that no one
becommeth amourous, according to the duty of election, but as the
appetite shapeth his course, against whose lawes my strength made
many resistances, which not prevailing, I presumed to love, did, and
so for ever shall doe, your Majestie.</p>

<p>Now Royall Soveraigne, I must needes confesse, that so soone as
I felt my selfe thus wholly conquered by loving you, I resolved for
ever after, to make your will mine owne, and therefore, am not onely
willing to accept him for my Husband, whom you shall please to
appoint, befitting my honour and degree: but if you will have me to
live in a flaming fire, my obedience shall sacrifice it selfe to your
will, with the absolute conformity of mine owne. To stile you by
the name of my Knight, whom I know to be my lawfull King and
Soveraigne; you are not ignorant, how farre unfitting a word that
were for me to use: As also the kisse which you request, in requitall
of my love to you; to these two I wil never give consent, without
the Queenes most gracious favour and license first granted. Neverthelesse,
for such admirable benignity used to me, both by your
Royall selfe, and your vertuous Queene: heaven shower downe all
boundlesse graces on you both, for it exceedeth all merit in me, and
so she ceased speaking, in most dutifull manner.</p>

<p>The answer of <i>Lisana</i> pleased the Queene exceedingly, in finding
her to be so wise and faire, as the King himself had before informed
her: who instantly called for her Father and Mother, and knowing
they would be well pleased with whatsoever he did; he called for a
proper young Gentleman, but some what poore, being named <i>Perdicano</i>,
and putting certaine Rings into his hand, which he refused
not to receive, caused him there to espouse <i>Lisana</i>. To whome the
King gave immediately (besides Chaines and Jewels of inestimable
valew, delivered by the Queene to the Bride) <i>Ceffala</i> and <i>Calatabelotta</i>,
two great territories abounding in divers wealthy possessions,
saying to <i>Perdicano</i>. These wee give thee, as a dowry in marriage
with this beautifull Maid, and greater gifts we will bestow on thee
hereafter, as we shal perceive thy love and kindnesse to her.</p>

<p>When he had ended these words, hee turned to <i>Lisana</i>, saying:
Heere doe I freely give over all further fruits of your affection towards
me, thanking you for your former love: so taking her head
betweene his hands, he kissed her faire forhead, which was the usuall
custome in those times. <i>Perdicano</i>, the Father and Mother of
<i>Lisana</i>, and she her selfe likewise, extraordinarily joyfulll for this so
fortunate a marriage, returned humble and hearty thankes both to
the King and Queene, and (as many credible Authors doe affirme)
the King kept his promise made to <i>Lisana</i>, because (so long as he lived)
he alwaies termed himselfe by the name of her Knight, and in
al actions of Chivalry by him undertaken, he never carried any other
devise, but such as he received still from her.</p>

<p>By this, and divers other like worthy deeds, not onely did he win
the hearts of his subjects; but gave occasion to the whole world beside,
to renowne his fame to all succeeding posterity. Whereto (in
these more wretched times of ours) few or none bend the sway of
their understanding: but rather how to bee cruell and tyrranous
Lords, and thereby win the hatred of their people.</p>

<h2>The eight Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Declaring, that notwithstanding the frownes of Fortune, diversity
of occurrences, and contrary accidents happening: yet love and friendship
ought to be preciously preserved among men.</i></h4>


<p>By this time Madam <i>Philomena</i>, at command of the King,
(Madam <i>Pampinea</i> ceasing) prepared to follow next in
order, whereupon thus she began. What is it (Gracious
Ladies) that Kings can not do (if they list) in matters of greatest importance,
and especially unto such as most they should declare their
magnificence? He then that performeth what he ought to do, when
it is within his owne power, doth well. But it is not so much to bee
admired, neither deserveth halfe the commendations, as when one
man doth good to another, when least it is expected, as being out of
his power, and yet performed. In which respect, because you have
so extolled king <i>Piero</i>, as appearing not meanly meritorious in your
judgements; I make no doubt but you will be much more pleased,
when the actions of our equals are duly considered, and shal paralell
any of the greatest Kings. Wherefore I purpose to tell you a
Novel, concerning an honourable curtesie of two worthy friends.</p>

<p>At such time as <i>Octavius Cæsar</i> (not as yet named <i>Augustus</i>, but
only in the office called <i>Triumveri</i>) governed the <i>Romane</i> Empire,
there dwelt in <i>Rome</i> a Gentleman, named <i>Publius Quintus Fulvius</i>,
a man of singular understanding, who having one son, called <i>Titus
Quintus Fulvius</i>, of towardly yeares and apprehension, sent him to
<i>Athens</i> to learne Philosophy; but with letters of familiar commendations,
to a Noble <i>Athenian</i> Gentleman, named <i>Chremes</i>, being his
ancient friend, of long acquaintance. This Gentleman lodged <i>Titus</i>
in his owne House, as companion to his son, named <i>Gisippus</i>, both of
them studying together, under the tutoring of a Philosopher, called
<i>Aristippus</i>. These two young Gentlemen living thus in one City,
House, and Schoole, it bred betweene them such a brother-hoode
and amity, as they could not be severed from one another; but only
by the accident of death; nor could either of them enjoy any content,
but when they were both together in company.</p>

<p>Being each of them endued with gentle spirits, and having begun
their studies together: they arose (by degrees) to the glorious height
of Philosophy, to their much admired fame and commendation. In
this manner they lived, to the no meane comfort of <i>Chremes</i>, hardly
distinguishing the one from the other for his Son, &amp; thus the Scholars
continued the space of three yeares. At the ending whereof (as it
hapneth in al things else) <i>Chremes</i> died, whereat both the young
Gentlemen conceived such hearty griefe, as if he had bin their common
father; nor could the kinred of <i>Chremes</i> discerne, which of the
two had most need of comfort, the losse touched them so equally.</p>

<p>It chanced within some few months after, that the kinred of <i>Gisippus</i>
came to see him, and (before <i>Titus</i>) avised him to marriage, and
with a young Gentlewoman of singular beauty, derived from a most
noble house in <i>Athens</i>, and she named <i>Sophronia</i>, aged about fifteen
years. This mariage drawing neere, <i>Gisippus</i> on a day, intreated <i>Titus</i>
to walk along with him thither, because (as yet) he had not seene
her. Comming to the house, and she sitting in the midst betweene
them, <i>Titus</i> making himselfe a considerator of beauty, &amp; especially
on his friends behalfe; began to observe her very judicially, &amp; every
part of her seemed so pleasing in his eie, that giving them al a privat
praise, yet answerable to their due deserving; he becam so enflamed
with affection to her, as never any lover could bee more violentlie
surprized, so sodainly doth beauty beguile our best senses.</p>

<p>After they had sate an indifferent while with her, they returned
home to their lodging, where <i>Titus</i> being alone in his chamber, began
to bethink himselfe on her, whose perfections had so powerfully
pleased him: and the more he entred into this consideration, the
fiercer he felt his desires enflamed, which being unable to quench,
by any reasonable perswasions, after hee had vented foorth infinite
sighes, thus he questioned with himselfe.</p>

<p>Most unhappie <i>Titus</i> as thou art, whether doost thou transport
thine understanding, love, and hope? Dooest thou not know as
well by the honourable favours, which thou hast received of <i>Chremes</i>
and his house, as also the intire amity betweene thee and <i>Gisippus</i>
(unto whom faire <i>Sophronia</i> is the affianced friend) that thou
shouldst holde her in the like reverent respect, as if shee were thy
true borne Sister? Darest thou presume to fancie her? Whether
shall beguiling Love allure thee, and vaine immaging hopes carrie
thee? Open the eyes of thy better understanding, and acknowledge
thy selfe to bee a most miserable man. Give way to reason,
bridle thine intemperate appetites, reforme all irregulare desires,
and guide thy fancy to a place of better direction. Resist thy wanton
and lascivious will in the beginning, and be master of thy selfe,
while thou hast opportunity, for that which thou aimest at, is neither
reasonable nor honest. And if thou wert assured to prevaile upon
this pursuite, yet thou oughtst to avoide it, if thou hast any regard
of true friendship, and the duty therein justly required. What
wilt thou do then <i>Titus</i>? Fly from this inordinate affection, if thou
wilt be reputed to be a man of sensible judgement.</p>

<p>After he had thus discoursed with himselfe, remembring <i>Sophronia</i>,
and converting his former allegations, into a quite contrarie
sense, in utter detestation of them, and guided by his idle appetite,
thus he began againe. The lawes of love are of greater force, then any
other whatsoever, they not only breake the bands of friendship,
but even those also of more divine consequence. How many times
hath it bin noted, the father to affect his own daughter, the brother
his sister, and the stepmother her son in law, matters far more monstrous,
then to see one friend love the wife of another, a case happening
continually? Moreover, I am young, and youth is wholly subjected
to the passions of Love: is it reasonable then, that those should
be bard from me, which are fitting and pleasing to Love? Honest
things, belong to men of more years and maturity, then I am troubled
withall, and I can covet none, but onely those wherein Love is
directer. The beauty of <i>Sophronia</i> is worthy of generall love, and if I
that am a youngman do love her, what man living can justly reprove
me for it? Shold not I love her, because she is affianced to <i>Gisippus</i>?
That is no matter to me, I ought to love her, because she is a woman,
and women were created for no other occasion, but to bee Loved.
Fortune had sinned in this case, and not I, in directing my friends affection
to her, rather then any other; and if she ought to be loved, as
her perfections do challenge, <i>Gisippus</i> understanding that I affect
her, may be the better contented that it is I, rather then any other.</p>

<p>With these, and the like crosse entercourses, he often mockt himselfe,
falling into the contrary, and then to this againe, and from the
contrary, into another kind of alteration, wasting and consuming
himselfe, not only this day and the night following, but many more
afterward, til he lost both his feeding &amp; sleepe, so that through debility
of body, he was constrained to keepe his bed. <i>Gisippus</i>, who had
divers dayes noted his melancholly disposition, and now his falling
into extreamitie of sicknesse, was very sorry to behold it: and with
all meanes and inventions he could devise to use, hee both questioned
the cause of this straunge alteration, and essayed everie way,
how hee might best comfort him, never ceassing to demaunde
a reason, why he should become thus sad and sickely. But <i>Titus</i>
after infinite importuning, which still he answered with idle and frivolous
excuses, farre from the truth indeede, and (to the no meane
affliction of his friend) when he was able to use no more contradictions;
at length, in sighes and teares, thus he replyed.</p>

<p><i>Gisippus</i>, were the Gods so wel pleased, I could more gladly yeild
to dye, then continue any longer in this wretched life, considering,
that Fortune hath brought mee to such an extremity, as proofe is
now to be made of my constancie and vertue; both which I finde
conquered in me, to my eternall confusion and shame. But my best
hope is, that I shal shortly be requited, as I have in justice deserved,
namely with death, which will be a thousand times more welcome
to me, then a loathed life, with remembrance of my base dejection
in courage, which because I can no longer conceale from thee; not
without blushing shame, I am well contented for to let thee know
it.</p>

<p>Then began hee to recount, the whole occasion of this straunge
conflict in him, what a maine battaile hee had with his private
thoughts, confessing that they got the victory, causing him to die
hourely for the love of <i>Sophronia</i>, and affirming withall, that in due
acknowledgement, how greatly hee had transgressed against the
lawes of friendship, he thought no other penance sufficient for him,
but onely death, which he willingly expected every houre, and with
all his heart would gladly bid welcome.</p>

<p><i>Gisippus</i> hearing this discourse, and seeing how <i>Titus</i> bitterly
wept, in agonies of most moving afflictions: sat an indifferent while
sad and pensive, as being wounded with affection to <i>Sophronia</i>, but
yet in a well-governed and temperate manner. So, without any
long delaying, hee concluded with himselfe; that the life of his
friend ought to be accounted much more deare, then any love hee
could beare unto <i>Sophronia</i>: And in this resolution, the teares of
<i>Titus</i> forcing his eyes to flow forth like two Fountaines, thus he replyed.</p>

<p><i>Titus</i>, if thou hadst not neede of comfort, as plainly I see thou
hast, I would justly complaine of thee to my selfe, as of the man
who hath violated our friendship, in keeping thine extreamitie so
long time concealed from mee, which hath beene over-tedious for
thee to endure. And although it might seeme to thee a dishonest
case, and therefore kept from the knowledge of thy friend, yet I
plainly tell thee, that dishonest courses (in the league of amitie) deserve
no more concealment, then those of the honestest nature. But
leaving these impertinent wandrings, let us come to them of much
greater necessitie.</p>

<p>If thou doest earnestly love faire <i>Sophronia</i>, who is betroathed
and affianced to me, it is no matter for me to marvaile at: but I
should rather be much abashed, if thou couldst not intyrely affect
her, knowing how beautifull she is, and the nobility of her minde,
being as able to sustaine passion, as the thing pleasing is fullest of
excellence. And looke how reasonably thou fanciest <i>Sophronia</i>, as
unjustly thou complainest of thy fortune, in ordaining her to be
my wife, although thou doest not speake it expresly: as being of opinion,
that thou mightest with more honesty love her, if she were any
others, then mine. But if thou art so wise, as I have alwayes held
thee to be, tell me truely upon thy faith, to whom could Fortune
better guide her, and for which thou oughtest to be more thankfull,
then in bestowing her on me? Any other that had enjoyed her, although
thy love were never so honest, yet he would better affect
her himselfe, then for thee, which thou canst not (in like manner)
looke for from me, if thou doest account me for thy friend, and as
constant now as ever.</p>

<p>Reason is my warrant in this case, because I cannot remember,
since first our entrance into friendship, that ever I enjoyed any
thing, but it was as much thine, as mine. And if our affaires had
such an equall course before, as otherwise they could not subsist;
must they not now be kept in the same manner? Can any thing
more perticularly appertaine to me, but thy right therein is as absolute
as mine? I know not how thou maist esteeme of my friendship, if in
any thing concerning my selfe, I can plead my priviledge
to be above thine. True it is, that <i>Sophronia</i> is affianced to me, and
I love her dearely, daily expecting when our nuptials shall be celebrated.
But seeing thou doest more fervently affect her, as being
better able to judge of the perfections, remaining in so excellent a
creature as she is, then I doe: assure thy selfe, and beleeve it constantly,
that she shall come to my bed, not as my wife, but onely
thine. And therefore leave these despairing thoughts, shake off
this cloudy disposition, reassume thy former Joviall spirit, with
comfort and what else can content thee: in expectation of the happy
houre, and the just requitall of thy long, loving, and worthy
friendship, which I have alwayes valued equall with mine owne
life.</p>

<p><i>Titus</i> hearing this answer of <i>Gisippus</i>, looke how much the sweet
hope of that which he desired gave him pleasure, as much both duty
and reason affronted him with shame; setting before his eyes
this du consideration, that the greater the liberality of <i>Gisippus</i> was,
farre greater and unreasonable it appeared to him in disgrace, if hee
should unmannerly accept it. Wherefore, being unable to refrain
from teares, and with such strength as his weaknesse would give
leave, thus he replyed.</p>

<p><i>Gisippus</i>, thy bounty and firme friendship suffereth me to see apparantly,
what (on my part) is no more then ought to be done. All
the Gods forbid, that I should receive as mine, her whom they have
adjudged to be thine, by true respect of birth and desert. For if they
had thought her a wife fit for me, doe not thou or any else imagine,
that ever she should have beene granted to thee. Use freely therefore
thine owne election, and the gracious favour wherewith they
have blessed thee: leave me to consume away in teares, a mourning
garment by them appointed for me, as being a man unworthy of
such happinesse; for either I shall conquer this disaster, and that wil
be my crowne, or else will vanquish me, and free me from all paine:
whereto <i>Gisippus</i> presently thus answered.</p>

<p>Worthy <i>Titus</i>, if our amity would give me so much licence, as
but to contend with my selfe, in pleasing thee with such a thing as I
desire, and could also induce thee therein to be directed: it is the
onely end whereat I aime, and am resolved to pursue it. In which
regard, let my perswasions prevaile with thee, and thereto I conjure
thee, by the faith of a friend, suffer me to use mine authority, when
it extendeth both to mine owne honour, and thy good, for I will
have <i>Sophronia</i> to bee onely thine. I know sufficiently, how
farre the forces of love doe extend in power, and am not ignorant
also, how not once or twice, but very many times, they have
brought lovers to unfortunate ends, as now I see thee very neere it,
and so farre gone, as thou art not able to turne backe againe, nor yet
to conquer thine owne teares, but proceeding on further in this extremity,
thou wilt be left vanquished, sinking under the burthen of
loves tyrannicall oppression, and then my turne is next to follow
thee. And therefore, had I no other reason to love thee, yet because
thy life is deare to me, in regard of mine owne depending
thereon; I stand the neerer thereto obliged. For this cause, <i>Sophronia</i>
must and shal be thine, for thou canst not find any other so conforme
to thy fancy: albeit I who can easily convert my liking to another
wife, but never to have the like friend againe, shall hereby
content both thee, and my selfe.</p>

<p>Yet perhaps this is not a matter so easily done, or I to expresse
such liberality therein, if wives were to be found with the like difficultie,
as true and faithfull friends are: but, (being able to recover
another wife) though never such a worthy friend; I rather chuse to
change, I doe not say loose her (for in giving her to thee, I loose her
not my selfe) and by this change, make that which was good before,
tenne times better, and so preserve both thee and my selfe. To this
end therefore, if my prayers and perswasions have any power with
thee, I earnestly entreat thee, that, by freeing thy selfe out of this affliction,
thou wilt (in one instant) make us both truely comforted,
and dispose thy selfe (living in hope) to embrace that happinesse,
which the fervent love thou bearest to <i>Sophronia</i>, hath justly deserved.</p>

<p>Now although <i>Titus</i> was confounded with shame, to yeeld consent,
that <i>Sophronia</i> should be accepted as his wife, and used many
obstinate resistances: yet notwithstanding, Love pleading on the
one side powerfully, and <i>Gisippus</i> as earnestly perswading on the other, thus
he answered. <i>Gisippus</i>, I know not what to say, neither
how to behave my selfe in this election, concerning the fitting of
mine contentment, or pleasing thee in thy importunate perswasion.
But seeing thy liberality is so great, as it surmounteth all reason or
shame in me, I will yeeld obedience to thy more then noble nature.
Yet let this remaine for thine assurance, that I doe not receive this
grace of thine, as a man not sufficiently understanding, how I enjoy
from thee, not onely her whom most of all I doe affect, but also doe
hold my very life of thee. Grant then you greatest Gods (if you
be the Patrones of this mine unexpected felicitie) that with honour
and due respect, I may hereafter make apparantly knowne: how
highly I acknowledge this thy wonderfull favour, in being more
mercifull to me, then I could be to my selfe.</p>

<p>For abridging of all further circumstances, answered <i>Gisippus</i>,
and for easier bringing this matter to full effect, I hold this to be
our onely way. It is not unknowne to thee, how after much discourse
had between my kindred, and those belonging to <i>Sophronia</i>,
the matrimoniall conjunction was fully agreed on, and therefore,
if now I shall flye off, and say, I will not accept thee as my wife:
great scandall would arise thereby, and make much trouble among
our friends, which could not be greatly displeasing to me, if that
were the way to make her thine. But I rather stand in feare, that if
I forsake her in such peremptory sort, her kinred and friends will
bestow her on some other, and so she is utterly lost, without all possible
meanes of recovery. For prevention therefore of all sinister
accidents, I thinke it best, (if thy opinion jumpe with mine) that I
still pursue the busines, as already I have begun, having thee alwaies
in my company, as my dearest friend and onely associate. The nuptials
being performed with our friends, in secret manner at night (as
we can cunningly enough contrive it) thou shalt have her maiden
honour in bed, even as if she were thine owne wife. Afterward,
in apt time and place, we will publiquely make knowne what
is done; if they take it well, we will be as jocond as they: if they
frowne and waxe offended, the deed is done, over-late to be recalled,
and so perforce they must rest contented.</p>

<p>You may well imagine, this advise was not a little pleasing to
<i>Titus</i>, whereupon <i>Gisippus</i> received home <i>Sophronia</i> into his house,
with publike intention to make her his wife, according as was the
custome then observed, and <i>Titus</i> being perfectly recovered, was
present at the Feast very ceremonially observed. When night was
come, the Ladies and Gentlewomen conducted <i>Sophronia</i> to the
Bride-Chamber, where they left her in her Husbands bed, and then
departed all away. The Chamber wherein <i>Titus</i> used to lodge, joyned
close to that of <i>Gisippus</i>, for their easier accesse each to the other,
at all times whensoever they pleased, and <i>Gisippus</i> being alone
in the Bride-Chamber, preparing as if he were comming to bed:
extinguishing the light, he went softly to <i>Titus</i>, willing him to goe
to bed to his wife. Which <i>Titus</i> hearing, overcome with shame
and feare, became repentant, and denyed to goe. But <i>Gisippus</i>, being
a true intyre friend indeed, and confirming his words with actions:
after a little lingering dispute, sent him to the Bride, and so soone as
he was in the bed with her, taking <i>Sophronia</i> gently by the hand,
softly he moved the usuall question to her, namely, if she were willing
to be his wife.</p>

<p>She beleeving verily that he was <i>Gisippus</i>, modestly answered.
Sir, I have chosen you to be my Husband, reason requires then, that
I should be willing to be your Wife. At which words, a costly
Ring, which <i>Gisippus</i> used daily to weare, he put upon her finger,
saying. With this Ring, I confesse my selfe to be your Husband,
and bind you (for ever) my Spouse and Wife; no other kind of
marriage was observed in those dayes; and so he continued all the
night with her, she never suspecting him to be any other then <i>Gisippus</i>,
and thus was the marriage consumated, betweene <i>Titus</i> and <i>Sophronia</i>,
albeit the friends (on either side) thought otherwise.</p>

<p>By this time, <i>Publius</i>, the father of <i>Titus</i>, was departed out of this
mortall life, &amp; letters came to <i>Athens</i>, that with all speed he should
returne to <i>Rome</i>, to take order for occasions there concerning him,
wherefore he concluded with <i>Gisippus</i> about his departure, and taking
<i>Sophronia</i> thither with him, which was no easie matter to be
done, until it were first known, how occasions had bin caried among
them. Wherupon, calling her one day into her Chamber, they told
her entirely, how all had past, which <i>Titus</i> confirmed substantially,
by such direct passages betweene themselves, as exceeded all possibility
of denyall, and moved in her much admiration; looking each
on other very discontentedly, she heavily weeping and lamenting,
&amp; greatly complaining of <i>Gisippus</i>, for wronging her so unkindly.</p>

<p>But before any further noyse was made in the house, shee went
to her Father, to whom, as also to her Mother, shee declared the
whole trecherie, how much both they and their other friends were
wronged by <i>Gisippus</i>, avouching her selfe to be the wife of <i>Titus</i>,
and not of <i>Gisippus</i>, as they supposed. These newes were highly
displeasing to the Father of <i>Sophronia</i>, who with hir kinred, as also
those of <i>Gisippus</i>, made great complaints to the Senate, very dangerous
troubles and commotions arising daily betweene them, drawing
both <i>Gisippus</i> and <i>Sophronia</i> into harsh reports; he being generally
reputed, not onely worthy of all bitter reproofe, but also the
severest punishment. Neverthelesse, hee maintained publikely
what he had done, avouching it for an act both of honour and honestie,
wherewith <i>Sophronia's</i> friends had no reason to bee offended,
but rather to take it in very thankfull part, having married a
man of farre greater worth and respect, than himselfe was, or
could be.</p>

<p>On the other side, <i>Titus</i> hearing these uncivill acclamations, became
much moved and provoked at them, but knowing it was a custome
observed among the <i>Greekes</i>, to be so much the more hurried
away with rumours and threatnings, as lesse they finde them to be
answered, and when they finde them, shew themselves not onely
humble enough, but rather as base men, and of no courage; he resolved
with himselfe, that their braveries were no longer to be endured,
without some some bold and manly answere. And having a
Romane heart, as also an Athenian understanding, by politique
perswasions, he caused the kinred of <i>Gisippus</i> and <i>Sophronia</i>, to be assembled
in a Temple, and himselfe comming thither, accompanied
with none but <i>Gisippus</i> onely, he began to deliver his minde before
them all, in this manner following.</p>

<blockquote>

<h4>The Oration uttered by <i>Titus Quintus Fulvius</i>, in the
hearing of the Athenians, being the kinred
and friends to <i>Gisippus</i> and <i>Sophronia</i>.</h4>


<p><i>Many Philosophers doe hold opinion, that the actions performed
by mortall men, doe proceed from the disposing and ordination
of the immortall gods. Whereupon some doe maintaine, that
things which be done, or never are to be done, proceed of necessity: howbeit
some other doe hold, that this necessity is onely referred to things
done. Both which opinions (if they be considered with mature judgment)
doe most manifestly approve, that they who reprehend any thing which is
irrevocable, doe nothing else but shew themselves, as if they were wiser
then the Gods, who we are to beleeve, that with perpetuall reason, and
void of any error, doe dispose and governe both us, and all our actions;
In which respect, how foolish and beast-like a thing it is, presumptuously
to checke or controule their operations, you may very easily consider; and
likewise, how justly they deserve condigne punishment, who suffer themselves
to be transported in so temerarious a manner.</i></p>

<p><i>In which notorious transgression, I understand you all to be guiltie, if
common fame speake truely, concerning the marriage of my selfe and</i> Sophronia,
<i>whom you imagined as given to</i> Gisippus; <i>for you never remember
that it was so ordained from eternitie, shee to be mine, and no
Wife for</i> Gisippus, <i>as at this instant is made manifest by full effect.
But because the kinde of speaking, concerning divine providence, and
intention of the Gods, may seeme a difficult matter to many, and somewhat
hard to bee understood: I am content to presuppose, that they
meddle not with any thing of ours, and will onely stay my selfe on humane
reasons, and in this nature of speech, I shall be enforced to doe
two things, quite contrary to my naturall disposition. The one is, to
speake somewhat in praise and commendation of my selfe: And the other,
justly to blame and condemne other mens seeming estimation. But
because both in the one and the other, I doe not intend to swerve a
jot from the Truth, and the necessitie of the present case in question,
doth not onely require, but also command it, you must pardon what I
am to say.</i></p>

<p><i>Your complaints doe proceed, rather from furie then reason, and (with
continuall murmurings, or rather seditious) slander, backe-bite and
condemne</i> Gisippus, <i>because (of his owne free will and noble disposition)
hee gave her to be my Wife, whom (by your election) was made
his; wherein I account him most highly praise-worthy: and the reasons
inducing mee thereunto, are these. The first, because he hath performed
no more then what a friend ought to doe: And the second, in regard he
hath dealt more wisely, then you did. I have no intention, to display (at
this present) what the sacred law of amitie requireth, to be acted by one
friend towards another, it shall suffice mee onely to informe you, that
the league of friendship (farre stronger then the bond of bloud and kinred)
confirmed us in our election of either at the first, to be true, loyall
and perpetuall friends; whereas that of kinred, commeth onely by fortune
or chance. And therefore if</i> Gisippus <i>affected more my life, then
your benevolence, I being ordained for his friend, as I confesse my selfe
to be; none of you ought to wonder thereat, in regard it is no matter of
mervaile.</i></p>

<p><i>But let us come now to our second reason, wherein, with farre greater
instance I will shew you, that he hath (in this occasion) shewen himselfe to
be much more wise, then you did, or have done: because it plainely appeareth,
that you have no feeling of the divine providence, and much lesse
knowledge in the effects of friendship. I say, that your foresight, councell
and deliberation, gave</i> Sophronia <i>to</i> Gisippus, <i>a young Gentleman, and
a Philosopher:</i> Gisippus <i>likewise hath given her to a young Gentleman,
and a Philosopher, as himselfe is. Your discretion gave her to an Athenian;
the gift of</i> Gisippus, <i>is to a Romaine. Yours, to a Noble and honest
man; that of</i> Gisippus, <i>to one more Noble by race, and no lesse
honest then himselfe. Your judgement hath bestowed her on a rich young
man:</i> Gisippus <i>hath given her to one farre richer. Your wisedome
gave her to one who not onely loved her not, but also one that had no
desire to know her:</i> Gisippus <i>gave her unto him, who, above all felicitie
else, yea, more than his owne life, both entirely loved and desired
her.</i></p>

<p><i>Now, for proofe of that which I have said, to be most true and infallible,
and that his deede deserveth to bee much more commended then
yours, let it bee duely considered on, point by point. That I am a young
man and a Philosopher, as</i> Gisippus <i>is; my yeares, face, and studies,
without seeking after further proofe, doth sufficiently testifie: One
selfe-same age is both his and mine, in like quality of course have wee
lived and studied together. True it is, that hee is an Athenian, and
I am a Romaine. But if the glory of these two Cities should bee disputed
on: then let mee tell you, that I am of a Citie that is Francke and
Free, and hee is of a Tributarie Citie. I say, that I am of a Citie,
which is chiefe Lady and Mistresse of the whole World, and hee is of a
Citie subject to mine. I say that I am of a Citie, that is strong in Arms,
Empire, and studies: whereas his can commend it selfe but for Studies
onely. And although you see me heere to bee a Scholler, in appearance
meane enough, yet I am not descended of the simplest stocke in
Rome.</i></p>

<p><i>My houses and publique places, are filled with the ancient Statues of
my Predecessors, and the Annales recorde the infinite triumphs of the
Quintii, brought home by them into the Romane Capitole, and yeares
cannot eate out the glory of our name, but it will live and flourish to all
posteritie.</i></p>

<p><i>Modest shame makes me silent in my wealth and possessions, my minde
truely telling mee, that honest contented povertie, is the most ancient and
richest inheritance, of our best and Noblest Romanes, which opinion,
if it bee condemned by the understanding of the ignorant multitude,
and heerein wee shall give way to them by preferring riches and worldly
treasures, then I can say that I am aboundantly provided, not as ambitious,
or greedily covetous, but sufficiently stored with the goods of
Fortune.</i></p>

<p><i>I know well enough, that you held it as a desired benefit,</i> Gisippus
<i>being a Native of your Citie, should also be linked to you by alliance:
but I know no reason, why I should not be as neere and deere to you at
Rome, as if I lived with you heere. Considering, when I am there, you
have a ready and well wishing friend, to stead you in all beneficiall and
serviceable offices, as carefull and provident for your support, yea, a
protectour of you and your affaires, as well publique as particular.
Who is it then, not transported with partiall affection, that can (in
reason) more approve your act, then that which my friend</i> Gisippus
<i>hath done? Questionlesse, not any one, as I thinke.</i> Sophronia <i>is
married to</i> Titus Quintus Fulvius, <i>a Noble Gentleman by antiquitie,
a rich Citizen of Rome, and (which is above all) the friend of</i> Gisippus:
<i>therfore, such a one as thinkes it strange, is sorrie for it, or would
not have it to be; knoweth not what he doth.</i></p>

<p><i>Perhaps there may be some, who will say, they doe not so much complain,
that</i> Sophronia <i>is the wife to</i> Titus; <i>but of the manner whereby
it was done, as being made his wife secretly, and by theft, not any of
her parents, kinred or friends called thereto: no, nor so much as advertised
thereof. Why Gentlemen, this is no miraculous thing, but
heeretofore hath oftentimes happened, and therefore no noveltie.</i></p>

<p><i>I cannot count unto you, how many there have beene, who (against
the will of their Fathers) have made choice of their husbands; nor
them that have fled away with their lovers into strange Countries, being
first friends, before they were wives: nor of them who have sooner
made testimonie of marriage by their bellies, then those ceremonies
due to matrimonie, or publication thereof by the tongue; so that meere
necessity &amp; constraint, hath forced the parents to yeeld consent: which
hath not so happened to</i> Sophronia, <i>for she was given to me by</i> Gisippus
<i>discreetly, honestly, and orderly.</i></p>

<p><i>Others also may say, that shee is married to him, to whom it belonged
not to marrie her. These complaints are foolish, and womanish,
proceeding from verie little, or no consideration at all. In these daies
of ours, Fortune makes no use of novell or inconsiderate meanes, whereby
to bring matters to their determined effect. Why should it offend
me, if a Cobler, rather than a Scholler, hath ended a businesse of mine,
either in private or publique, if the end be well made? Well I may take
order, if the Cobler bee indiscreet, that hee meddle no more with any
matters of mine, yet I ought, in courtesie, to thanke him for that which
hee did.</i></p>

<p><i>In like manner, if</i> Gisippus <i>hath married</i> Sophronia <i>well, it is
foolish and superfluous, to finde fault with the manner hee used in her
marriage. If you mislike his course in the case, beware of him hereafter,
yet thanke him because it is no worse.</i></p>

<p><i>Neverthelesse, you are to understand, that I sought not by fraud or
deceit, (but onely by witte) any opportunitie, whereby any way to sullie
the honestie and cleere Nobilitie of your bloud, in the person of</i> Sophronia:
<i>for although in secret I made her my wife, yet I came not as an enemie,
to take her perforce, nor (like a ravisher) wronged her virginitie, to
blemish your noble titles, or despising your alliance. But fervently, enflamed
by her bright beauty, and incited also by her unparalleld vertues,
I shaped my course; knowing well enough, that if I tooke the ordinarie
way of wiving, by moving the question to you, I should never winne your
consent, as fearing, lest I would take her with me to Rome, and so conveigh
out of your sight, a Jewell by you so much esteemed, as she is.</i></p>

<p><i>For this, and no other reason, did I presume to use the secret cunning
which now is openly made knowne unto you: and</i> Gisippus <i>disposed
himselfe thereunto, which otherwise hee never determined to have
done, in contracting the marriage for mee, and shee consenting to me
in his name.</i></p>

<p><i>Moreover, albeit most earnestly I affected her, I sought to procure
your union, not like a lover, but as a true husband, nor would I immodestly
touch her, till first (as herselfe can testifie) with the words becomming
wedlocke, and the Ring also I espoused her, demanding of her,
if shee would accept mee as her husband, and shee answered mee, with
her full consent. Wherein, if it may seeme that shee was deceived, I am
not any way to be blamed, but she, for not demanding, what, and who
I was.</i></p>

<p><i>This then is the great evill, the great offence, and the great injurie
committed by my friend</i> Gisippus, <i>and by mee as a Lover: that</i> Sophronia
<i>is secretly become the wife of</i> Titus Quintus Fulvius. <i>And for this
cause, like spies you watch him, threaten him daily, as if you intended to
teare him in pieces. What could you doe more, if hee had given her to a
man of the very vilest condition? to a villaine, to a slave? What prisons?
what fetters? Or what torments are sufficient for this fact? But
leaving these frivolous matters, let us come to discourse of more moment,
and better beseeming your attention.</i></p>

<p><i>The time is come, that I may no longer continue heere, because</i> Publius
<i>my Father is dead, and I must needs returne to Rome, wherefore being
minded to take</i> Sophronia <i>thither with mee, I was the more willing
to acquaint you therewith, as also what else I have said, which otherwise
had still beene concealed from you. Nor can you but take it in good part,
if you be wise, and rest well contented with what is done: considering, if
I had any intention eyther to deceive, or otherwise wrong you; I could
have basely left her, and made a scorne both of her and you, you not having
any power to stay mee heere. But the Gods will never permitte that
any couragious Romane, should ever conceive so vile and degenerate a
thought.</i></p>

<p>Sophronia, <i>by ordination of the Gods, by force of humane Lawes, and
by the laudable consent of my friend</i> Gisippus, <i>as also the powerfull
command of Love is mine. But you perchance, imagining your selves to
be wiser then the Gods, or any other men whatsoever; may thinke ill of
it, and more brutishly then beasts, condemne their working in two kinds,
which would be offensive to mee. The one is your detaining of</i> Sophronia
<i>from mee, of whom you have no power, but what pleaseth mee. The
other, is your bitter threatnings against</i> Gisippus <i>my deare friend, to
whom you are in duty obliged. In both which cases, how unreasonablie
soever you carrie your selves, I intend not at this time to presse any further.
But rather let mee counsell you like a friend, to cease your hatred
and disdaine, and suffer</i> Sophronia <i>to be delivered mee, that I may depart
contentedly from you as a kinsman, and (being absent) remaine your
friend: assuring you, that whether what is done shall please or displease
you, if you purpose to proceed any otherwise: I will take</i> Gisippus <i>along
with mee, and when I come to Rome, take such sure order, to fetch
her hence, who in Justice is mine, even in meere despight of you all, and
then you shall feele by sound experience, how powerfull is the just indignation
of the wronged Romanes.</i></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>When Titus had thus concluded his Oration, he arose with
a sterne and discontented countenance, and tooke <i>Gisippus</i>
by the hand, plainly declaring, that he made small account
of all the rest that were in the Temple; and shaking his head
at them, rather menaced then any other wise seemed to care for
them.</p>

<p>They which tarried, when they were gone, considering partly
on the reasons alleadged by <i>Titus</i>, and partly terrified by his latest
speeches; became induced, to like well of his alliance and amitie, as
(with common consent) they concluded: that it was much better
to accept <i>Titus</i> as their kinsman (seeing <i>Gisippus</i> had made manifest
refusall thereof) than to lose the kinred of the one, and procure
the hatred of the other. Wherefore they went to seeke <i>Titus</i>, and
said unto him, they were very well contented that <i>Sophronia</i> should
bee his Wife, hee their deare and loving kinsman, and <i>Gisippus</i>
to remaine their much respected friend. And embracing one another,
making a solemne feast, such as in the like cases is necessarilie
required, they departed from him, presently sending <i>Sophronia</i>
to him, who making a vertue of necessity, converted her
love (in short time after) to <i>Titus</i>, in as effectuall manner, as
formerly shee had done to <i>Gisippus</i>, and so was sent away with
him to Rome, where she was received and welcommed with very
great honour.</p>

<p><i>Gisippus</i> remaining still at <i>Athens</i>, in small regard of eyther theirs
or his owne friends: not long after by meanes of sundry troublesome
Citizens; and partialities happening among the common
people, was banished from <i>Athens</i>, and hee, as also all his familie,
condemned to perpetuall exile: during which tempestuous time,
<i>Gisippus</i> was become not onely wretchedly poore, but wandred abroad
as a common begger; in which miserable condition he travelled
to <i>Rome</i>, to try if <i>Titus</i> would take any acknowledgement of
him. Understanding that he was living, and one most respected among
the Romanes, as being a great Commander and a Senator:
he enquired for the place where hee dwelt, and going to be neere
about his house, stayed there so long, till <i>Titus</i> came home, yet
not daring to manifest himselfe, or speake a word to him, in regard
of his poore and miserable estate, but strove to have him see
him, to the end, that hee might acknowledge and call him by
his name; notwithstanding, <i>Titus</i> passed by him without either
speech, or looking on him. Which when <i>Gisippus</i> perceived, and
making full account, that (at the least) he would remember him, in
regard of former courtesies, done to him: confounded with griefe
and desperate thoughts, hee departed thence, never meaning to see
him any more.</p>

<p>Now, in regard it was night, he having eaten nothing all that day,
nor provided of one penny to buy him any food, wandred he knew
not whether, desiring rather to die than live; hee came at last to an
old ruinous part of the City, over-spred with briers and bushes, and
seldome resorted unto by any: where finding a hollow Cave or
vault, he entred into it, meaning there to weare away the comfortlesse
night, and laying himselfe downe on the hard ground, almost
starke naked, and without any warme garments, over-wearied with
weeping, at last he fell into a sleepe.</p>

<p>It fortuned that two men, who had beene abroad the same night,
committing thefts and robberies together; somwhat very earlie in
the morning, came to the same Cave, intending there to share and
divide their booties, and difference happening betweene them
about it, hee that was the stronger person, slew there the other,
and then went away with the whole purchase.</p>

<p><i>Gisippus</i> having heard and seene the manner of this accident, was
not a little joyfulll, because he had now found a way to death, without
laying any violent hand on himselfe; for life being very loathsome
to him, it was his only desire to die. Wherefore, he would not
budge from the place, but taried there so long, till the Sergeants
and Officers of Justice (by information of him that did the deede)
came thither well attended, and furiously ledde <i>Gisippus</i> thence to
prison.</p>

<p>Being examined concerning this bloudy fact, he plainly confessed,
that hee himselfe had committed the murder, and afterward
would not depart from the Cave, but purposely stayed for apprehension,
as being truely toucht with compunction for so foule an
offence: upon which peremptorie confession, <i>Marcus Varro</i> being
then <i>Prætor</i>, gave sentence that he should be crucified on a Crosse,
as it was the usuall manner of death in those dayes. <i>Titus</i> chancing
to come at the same time into <i>Prætorium</i>, advisedly beholding
the face of the condemned man (as hee sate upon the bench) knew
him to bee <i>Gisippus</i>, not a little wondring at this strange accident,
the povertie of his estate, and what occasion should bring him thither,
especially in the questioning for his life, and before the Tribunall
of Justice.</p>

<p>His soule earnestly thirsting, by all possible meanes to helpe and
defend him, and no other course could now be taken for safetie of
his life, but by accusing himselfe, to excuse and cleare the other of
the crime: hee stept from off the judgement bench, and crouding
through the throng to the Barre, called out to the <i>Prætor</i> in this
manner. <i>Marcus Varro</i>, recall thy sentence given on the condemned
man sent away, because hee is truely guiltlesse and innocent:
With one bloudie blow have I offended the Gods, by killing that
wretched man, whom the Serjeants found this morning slaine,
wherefore Noble <i>Prætor</i>, let no innocent mans bloud be shed for
it, but onely mine that have offended.</p>

<p><i>Marcus Varro</i> stood like a man confounded with admiration, being
very sorrie, for that which the whole assistants had both seene
and heard, yet hee could not (with honour) desist from what must
needs be done, but would performe the Lawes severe injunction.
And sending for condemned <i>Gisippus</i> backe againe, in the presence
of <i>Titus</i>, thus he spake to him. How becamest thou so madly incensed,
as (without any torment inflicted on thee) to confesse an offence
by thee never committed? Art thou wearie of thy life? Thou
chargest thy selfe falsly, to be the person who this last night murdered
the man in the Cave, and there is another that voluntarily also
doth confesse his guiltinesse.</p>

<p><i>Gisippus</i> lifting up his eyes, and perceiving it was <i>Titus</i>, conceived
immediately, that he had done this onely for his deliverance,
as one that remembred him sufficiently, and would not be ungratefull
for former kindnesses received. Wherefore, the teares flowing
abundantly down his cheekes, he said to the Judge <i>Varro</i>, it was
none but I that murdered the man, wherefore, I commiserate the
case of this Noble Gentleman <i>Titus</i>, who speakes now too late for
the safety of my life. <i>Titus</i> on the other side, said. Noble Prætor,
this man (as thou seest) is a stranger heere, and was found without
any weapon, fast asleepe by the dead body: thou mayst then easily
perceive, that meerely the miserable condition wherein he is, hath
made him desperate, and he would make mine offence the occasion
of his death. Absolve him, and send me to the Crosse, for none but
I have deserved to die for this fact.</p>

<p><i>Varro</i> was amazed, to observe with what earnest instance each of
them strove to excuse the other, which halfe perswaded him in his
soule, that they were both guiltlesse. And as he was starting up, with
full intent to acquaint them: a young man, who had stood there all
this while, and observed the hard pleading on either side; he crowded
into the Barre, being named <i>Publius Ambustus</i>, a fellow of
lewd life, and utterly out of hopes, as being debauched in all his fortunes,
and knowne among the <i>Romaines</i> to be a notorious theefe,
who verily had committed the murder. Well knew his conscience,
that none of them were guilty of the crime, wherewith each so
wilfully charged himselfe: being therefore truely toucht with remorse,
he stept before <i>Marcus Varro</i>, saying.</p>

<p>Honourable Prætor, mine owne horrid and abominable actions,
have induced me thus to intrude my selfe, for clearing the strict
contention betweene these two persons. And questionlesse, some
God or greater power, hath tormented my wretched soule, and so
compunctually solicited me, as I cannot chuse, but make open confession
of my sinne. Here therefore, I doe apparantly publish, that
neither of these men is guilty of the offence, wherewith so wilfully
each chargeth himselfe. I am the villaine, who this morning murdered
the man in the Cave, one of no greater honesty then my selfe,
and seeing this poore man lie there sleeping, while we were dividing
the stolne booties betweene us; I slew my Companyon, because
I would be the sole possessor. As for Noble Lord <i>Titus</i>, he
had no reason thus to accuse himselfe, because is a man of no such
base quality: let them both then be delivered, and inflict the sentence
of death on me.</p>

<p><i>Octavius Cæsar</i>, to whom tydings was brought of this rare accident,
commanding them al three to be brought before him; would
needs understand the whole History, in every particular as all had
happened, which was substantially related to him. Whereupon,
<i>Octavius</i> pleased them all three: the two noble friendes, because
they were innocent, and the third, for openly revealing the very
truth.</p>

<p><i>Titus</i> tooke home with him his friend <i>Gisippus</i>, and after he had
sharpely reproved him for his distrust, and cold credence of his
friendship: he brought him to <i>Sophronia</i>, who welcomed him as
lovingly, as if he had bin her naturall borne brother, bemoaning
his hard and disastrous fortune, and taking especiall care, to convert
all passed distresses, into as happy and comfortable a change, fitting
him with garments and attendants, beseeming his degree both in
Nobility and vertue. <i>Titus</i>, out of his honourable bounty, imparted
halfe his lands and rich possessions to him, and afterward gave
him in marriage, his owne Sister, a most beautifull Lady, named
<i>Fulvia</i>, saying to him beside. My deare friend <i>Gisippus</i>, it remaineth
now in thine owne election, whether thou wilt live here still
with me, or returne backe to <i>Athens</i>, with all the wealth which I
have bestowed on thee. But <i>Gisippus</i>, being one way constrayned,
by the sentence of banishment from his native City, &amp; then againe,
in regard of the constant love, which he bare to so true and thankefull
friend as <i>Titus</i> was: concluded to live there as a loyall <i>Roman</i>,
where he with his <i>Fulvia</i>, and <i>Titus</i> with his faire <i>Sophronia</i>, lived
long after together in one and the same house, augmenting daily
(if possible it might be) their amity beyond all other equalizing.</p>

<p>A most sacred thing therefore is cordiall amity, worthy not onely
of singuler reverence, but also to be honoured with eternall
commendation, as being the onely wise Mother of all magnificence
and honesty, the Sister of Charity and Gratitude, the enemy
to hatred and avarice, and which is alwayes ready (without attending
to be requested) to extend all vertuous actions to others,
which she would have done to her selfe. Her rare and divine
effects, in these contrary times of ours, are not to be found between
two such persons, which is a mighty fault, and greatly checketh the
miserable covetousnesse of men, who respecting nothing but onely
their particular benefit; have banished true Amity, to the
utmost confines of the whole earth, and sent her into perpetuall
exile.</p>

<p>What love, what wealth, or affinity of kindred, could have made
<i>Gisippus</i> feele (even in the intyrest part of his soule) the fervent
compassion, the teares, the sighes of <i>Titus</i>, and with such efficacy as
plainely appeared: to make him consent, that his faire elected
Spouse, by him so dearely esteemed, should become the wife of
his Companion, but onely the precious league of Amity? What
Lawes, what threatnings, what feares, could cause the young armes
of <i>Gisippus</i> to abstaine embraces, betaking himselfe to solitary
walkes, and obscure places, when in his owne bedde, he might have
enjoyed so matchlesse a beauty (who perhaps desired it so much as
himselfe) but onely the gracious title of Amity? What greatnesse,
what merits or precedence, could cause <i>Gisippus</i> not to care, for the
losse of his kindred, those of <i>Sophronia</i>, yea, of <i>Sophronia</i> her selfe,
not respecting the dishonest murmurings of base minded people,
their vile and contemptible language, scornes and mockeries,
and all to content and satisfie a friend, but onely Divine Amity?</p>

<p>Come now likewise to the other side. What occasions could
compell Noble <i>Titus</i>, so promptly and deliberatly, to procure his
owne death, to rescue his friend from the crosse, and inflict the pain
and shame upon himselfe, pretending not see or know <i>Gisippus</i> at
all, had it not bin wrought by powerfull Amity? What cause else
could make <i>Titus</i> so liberall, in dividing (with such willingnesse) the
larger part of his patrimony to <i>Gisippus</i>, when Fortune had dispossest
him of his owne, but onely heaven-borne Amity? What else
could have procured <i>Titus</i> without any further dilation, feare or
suspition, to give his Sister <i>Fulvia</i> in marriage to <i>Gisippus</i>, when he
saw him reduced to such extreame poverty, disgrace and misery,
but onely infinite Amity? To what end doe men care then, to covet
and procure great multitudes of kinred, store of brethren, numbers
of children, and to encrease (with their owne monyes) plenty
of servants: when by the least losse and dammage happening,
they forget all duty to Father, Brother, or Master? Amity and true
friendship is of a quite contrary nature, satisfying (in that sacred
bond) the obligation due to all degrees, both of parentage, and all
alliences else.</p>

<h2>The Ninth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Declaring what an honourable vertue Courtesie is, in them that truely
know how to use them.</i></h4>


<p>Madam <i>Philomena</i> having concluded her discourse, and
the rare acknowledgement, which <i>Titus</i> made of his
esteemed friend <i>Gisippus</i>, extolled justly as it deserved by
all the Company: the King, reserving the last office to <i>Dioneus</i> (as
it was at the first granted him) began to speake thus. Without all
question to the contrary (worthy Ladies) nothing can be more truely
said, then what Madame <i>Philomena</i>, hath delivered, concerning
Amity, and her complaint in the conclusion of her Novell, is not
without great reason, to see it so slenderly reverenced and respected
(now-a-dayes) among all men. But if we had met here in duty onely
for correcting the abuses of iniquity, and the malevolent courses
of this preposterous age; I could proceed further in this just cause
of complaint. But because our end aimeth at matters of other nature,
it commeth to my memory to tel you of a History, which (perhaps)
may seeme somewhat long, but altogether pleasant, concerning a
magnificent act of great <i>Saladine</i>: to the end, that by observing
those things which you shall heare in my Novell, if we cannot (by
reason of our manifold imperfections) intirely compasse the amity
of any one; yet (at least) we may take delight, in stretching our kindnesse
(in good deeds) so farre as we are able, in hope one day after,
some worthy reward will ensue thereon, as thereto justly appertaining.</p>

<p>Let me tell you then, that (as it is affirmed by many) in the time
of the Emperour Frederick, first of that name, the Christians, for
the better recovery of the holy land, resolved to make a generall
voyage over the Seas. Which being understood by <i>Saladine</i>, a
very worthy Prince, and then <i>Soldan</i> of Babylon: he concluded
with himselfe, that he would (in person) goe see, what preparation
the Christian Potentates made for this Warre, that hee might the
better provide for himselfe. Having setled all things orderly in
Ægypt for the busines, and making an outward appearance, as if he
purposed a pilgrimage to <i>Mecha</i>: he set onward on his journey,
habited like a Merchant, attended onely with two of his most Noble
and wisest Baschaes, and three waiting servants.</p>

<p>When he had visited many Christian Provinces, and was riding
thorow <i>Lombardie</i>, to passe the mountaines; it fortuned, in his journeying
from <i>Millaine</i> to <i>Pavia</i>, and the day being very farre spent,
so that night hastened speedily on him: he met with a Gentleman,
named Signior <i>Thorello d'Istria</i>, but dwelling at <i>Pavia</i>, who with
his men, Hawkes and Hounds, went to a house of his, seated in a
singular place, and on the River of <i>Ticinum</i>. Signior <i>Thorello</i> seeing
such men making towardes him, presently imagined, that they
were some Gentle-strangers, and such hee desired to respect with
honour.</p>

<p>Wherefore, <i>Saladine</i> demanding of one of <i>Thorelloes</i> men, how
farre (as then) it was to <i>Pavia</i>, and whether they might reach thither
by such an houre, as would admit their entrance into the City:
<i>Thorello</i> would not suffer his servant to returne the answer, but
replyed thus himselfe. Sir (quoth he) you cannot reach <i>Pavia</i>, but
night will abridge you of any entraunce there. I beseech you then
Sir, answered <i>Saladine</i>, favour us so much (because we are all strangers
in these parts) as to tell us where we may be well lodged. That
shal I Sir, said <i>Thorello</i>, and very gladly too.</p>

<p>Even at the instant Sir, as we met with you, I had determined in
my mind, to send one of my servants somewhat neere to <i>Pavia</i>, about
a businesse concerning my selfe: he shall go along with you,
and conduct you to a place, where you will be very well entertayned.
So, stepping to him, who was of best discretion amongst his
men, he gave order to him what should bee done, and sent him
with them. Himselfe, making hast by a farre neerer way, caused
Supper to be prepared in worthy manner, and the Tables to be covered
in his Garden; and all things being in good readinesse, he sate
downe at his doore, to attend the comming of his guests. The Servingman,
discoursing with the Gentlemen on divers occasions, guided
them by such unusuall passages, as (before they could discerne
it) he brought them to his Masters house; where so soone as <i>Thorello</i>
saw them arrived, he went forth to meet them, assuring them all of
most hearty welcome.</p>

<p><i>Saladine</i>, who was a man of accute understanding, did well perceive,
that this Knight <i>Thorello</i> misdoubted his going with him, if
(when he met him) hee should have invited him; and therefore, because
he would not be denied, of entertaining him into his house;
he made choise of this kinde and honourable course, which caused
him to returne this answer. Gentle Sir, if courtesie in one man to
another, do deserve condemning, then may we justly complaine of
you, who meeting us upon the way, which you have shortened by
your kindnesse; and which we are no way able to deserve, wee are
constrained to accept, taking you to bee the mirrour of courtesie.
<i>Thorello</i> being a Knight of ingenious apprehension, and wel languaged,
replyed thus.</p>

<p>Gentlemen; this courtesie (seeing you terme it so) which you
receive of me, in regard of that justly belonging to you, as your faces
do sufficiently informe mee, is matter of very slender account.
But assuredly out of <i>Pavia</i>, you could not have any lodging, deserving
to be termed good. And therefore, let it not bee displeasing
to you, if you have a little gone forth of the common rode way, to
have your entertainment somewhat bettered, as many travaylers
are easily induced to do.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, all the people of the house shewed themselves,
in serviceable manner to the Gentlemen, taking their horses
as they dismounted, and <i>Thorello</i> himselfe, conducted the three
Gentlemen, into three severall faire Chambers, which in costly manner
were prepared for them, where their boots were pluckt off, faire
Napkins with Manchets lay ready, and delicate Wines to refresh
their wearied spirits, much pretty conference being entercoursed, til
Supper time invited them thence.</p>

<p><i>Saladine</i>, and they that were with him, spake the Latine tongue
very readily, by which meanes they were the better understoode;
and <i>Thorello</i> seemed (in their judgement) to bee the most gracious,
compleate, and best spoken Gentleman, as ever they met with in all
their journey. It appeared also (on the other side) to Signiour <i>Thorello</i>,
that his guests were men of great merit, and worthy of much
more esteeme, then there he could use towards them: wherefore, it
did highly distast him, that he had no more friends there this night
to keepe them company, or himselfe better provided for their entertainment,
which hee intended (on the morrow) to recompence
with larger amends at dinner.</p>

<p>Heereupon, having instructed one of his men with what hee intended,
he sent him to <i>Pavia</i>, which was not farre off (and where he
kept no doore shut) to his Wife, named Madam <i>Adalietta</i>; a Woman
singularly wise, and of a Noble spirit, needing little or no direction,
especially when she knew her Husbands minde. As they were
walking in the Garden, <i>Thorello</i> desired to understand, of whence,
and what they were? Whereto <i>Saladine</i> thus answered. Sir, wee
are <i>Cyprian</i> Marchants, comming now from <i>Cyprus</i>, and are travailing
to <i>Paris</i>, about affaires of importance. Now trust me Syr, replyed
<i>Thorello</i>, I could heartily wish, that this Countrey of ours
would yeeld such Gentlemen, as your <i>Cyprus</i> affordeth Marchants.
So, falling from one discourse unto another, Supper was served in;
and looke howe best themselves pleased, so they sate at the Table,
where (we neede make no doubt) they were respected in honourable
order.</p>

<p>So soone as the Tables were withdrawne, <i>Thorello</i> knowing they
might be weary, brought them againe to their Chambers, where
committing them to their good rest, himselfe went to bed soone after.
The Servant sent to <i>Pavia</i>, delivered the message to his Lady;
who, not like a woman of ordinary disposition, but rather truely
Royall, sent <i>Thorelloes</i> servants into the City, to make preparation
for a Feast indeed, and with lighted Torches (because it was somewhat
late) they invited the very greatest and noblest persons of the
Citie, all the roomes being hanged with the richest Arras, Clothes
of Golde worke, Velvets, Silkes, and all other rich adornments, in
such manner as her husband had commanded, and answerable to
her owne worthy mind, being no way to learne, in what manner to
entertaine strangers.</p>

<p>On the morrow morning, the Gentlemen arose, and mounting
on horsebacke with Signior <i>Thorello</i>, he called for his Hawkes and
Hounds, brought them to the River, where he shewed two or three
faire flights: but <i>Saladine</i> desiring to know, which was the fayrest
Hostery in all <i>Pavia, Thorello</i> answered. Gentlemen, I wil shew you
that my selfe, in regard I have occasion to ride thither. Which they
beleeving, were the better contented, and rode on directly unto <i>Pavia</i>;
arriving there about nine of the clocke, and thinking he guided
them to the best Inne, he brought them to his owne house; where,
above fifty of the worthiest Citizens, stood ready to welcome the
Gentlemen, imbracing them as they lighted from their Horsses.
Which <i>Saladine</i>, and his associates perceiving, they guessed as it
was indeede, and <i>Saladine</i> sayd. Beleeve me worthy <i>Thorello</i>, this
is not answerable to my demand; you did too much yester-night,
and much more then we could desire or deserve: Wherefore, you
might wel be the sooner discharged of us, and let us travaile on our
journey.</p>

<p>Noble Gentlemen, replyed <i>Thorello</i> (for in mine eye you seeme
no lesse) that courtesie which you met with yester-night, I am to
thanke Fortune for, more then you, because you were then straited
by such necessity, as urged your acceptance of my poore Country
house. But now this morning, I shall account my selfe much beholding
to you (as the like will all these worthy Gentlemen here about
you) if you do but answer kindnes with kindnes, and not refuse
to take a homely dinner with them.</p>

<p><i>Saladine</i> and his friends, being conquerd with such potent perswasions,
and already dismounted from their horses, saw that all
deniall was meerly in vaine: and therefore thankfully condiscending
(after some few ceremonious complements were over-past) the
Gentlemen conducted them to their Chambers, which were most
sumptuously prepared for them, and having laid aside their riding
garments, being a little refreshed with Cakes and choice Wines:
they descended into the dining Hall, the pompe whereof I am not
able to report.</p>

<p>When they had washed, and were seated at the Tables, dinner
was served in most magnificent sort; so that if the Emperor himself
had bin there, he could not have bin more sumptuously served. And
although <i>Saladine</i> and his Baschaes were very Noble Lords, and
wonted to see matters of admiration: yet could they do no lesse
now, but rather exceeded in marvaile, considering the qualitie of
the Knight, whom they knew to bee a Citizen, and no Prince or
great Lord. Dinner being ended, and divers familiar conferences
passing amongst them: because it was exceeding hot, the Gentlemen
of <i>Pavia</i> (as it pleased <i>Thorello</i> to appoint) went to repose
themselves awhile, and he keeping company with his three guests,
brought them into a goodly Chamber, where, because he would
not faile in the least scruple of courtesie, or conceale from them the
richest Jewell which he had; he sent for his Lady and wife, because
(as yet) they had not seene her.</p>

<p>She was a Lady of extraordinary beauty, tall stature, very sumptuously
attired, and having two sweet Sonnes (resembling Angels)
she came with them waiting before her, and graciously saluted her
guests. At her comming, they arose, and having received hir with
great reverence, they seated her in the midst, kindly cherishing the
two Children. After some gracious Language past on eyther side,
she demanded of whence, and what they were, which they answered
in the same kind as they had done before to her husband. Afterward,
with a modest smiling countenance, she sayd. Worthy
Gentlemen, let not my weake Womanish discretion appeare distastable,
in desiring to crave one especiall favour from you, namely,
not to refuse or disdaine a small gift, wherewith I purpose to present
you. But considering first, that women (according to their simple
faculty) are able to bestow but silly gifts: so you would be pleased,
to respect more the person that is the giver, then the quality or
quantity of the gift.</p>

<p>Then causing to be brought (for each of them) two goodly gowns
or Robes (made after the <i>Persian</i> manner) the one lyned thorough
with cloth of Gold, and the other with the costlyest Fur; not after
such fashion as Citizens or Marchants use to weare, but rather beseeming
Lords of greatest account, and three light under-wearing
Cassocks or Mandillions, of Carnatian Sattin, richly Imbroidred
with Gold and Pearles, and lined thorow with White Taffata, presenting
these gifts to him, she sayd. I desire you Gentlemen to receive
these meane trifles, such as you see my Husband weares the
like, and these other beside, considering you are so far from your
Wives, having travailed a long way already, and many miles more
yet to overtake; also Marchants (being excellent men) affect to be
comely and handsome in their habits; although these are of slender
value, yet (in necessity) they may do you service.</p>

<p>Now was <i>Saladine</i> and his Baschaes halfe astonyed with admiration,
at the magnificent minde of Signiour <i>Thorello</i>, who would
not forget the least part of courtesie towardes them, and greatly
doubted (seeing the beauty and riches of the Garments) least they
were discovered by <i>Thorello</i>. Neverthelesse, one of them thus answered
the Lady. Beleeve me Madame, these are rich guiftes, not
lightly either to be given, or receyved: but in regard of your strict
imposition, we are not able to deny them. This being done, with
most gracious and courteous demeanour, she departed from them,
leaving her Husband to keepe them still companie; who furnished
their servants also, with divers worthy necessaries fitting for their
journey.</p>

<p>Afterward, <i>Thorello</i> (by very much importunitie) wonne them
to stay with him all the rest of the day; wherefore, when they had
rested themselves awhile, being attyred in their newly given robes;
they rode on Horsebacke thorow the City. When supper time
came, they supt in most honourable and worthy company, beeing
afterwards Lodged in most faire and sumptuous Chambers, and
being risen in the morning, in exchange of their horses (over-wearied
with Travaile) they found three other very richly furnished, and
their men also in like manner provided. Which when <i>Saladine</i>
had perceyved, he tooke his Baschaes aside, and spake in this manner.</p>

<p>By our greatest Gods, I never met with any man, more compleat
in all noble perfections, more courteous and kinde then <i>Thorello</i> is.
If all the Christian Kings, in the true and heroicall nature of Kings,
do deale as honourably as I see this Knight doeth, the Soldane of
<i>Babylon</i> is not able to endure the comming of one of them, much
lesse so many, as wee see preparing to make head against us. But
beholding, that both refusall and acceptation, was all one in the
minde of <i>Thorello</i>: after much kinde Language had bin intercoursed
betweene them, <i>Saladine</i> (with his Attendants) mounted on
horsebacke.</p>

<p>Signiour <i>Thorello</i>, with a number of his honourable Friends (to
the number of an hundred Horsse) accompanied them a great distance
from the Citie, and although it greeved <i>Saladine</i> exceedingly,
to leave the company of <i>Thorello</i>, so dearely he was affected to
him; but necessity (which controlleth the power of all lawes whatsoever)
must needs divide them: yet requesting his returne agayne
that way, if possibly it might be granted; which <i>Saladine</i> promised
but did not performe. Well Gentlemen (quoth <i>Thorello</i> at parting)
I know not what you are, neither (against your will) do I desire it:
but whether you be Marchants or no, remember me in your kindnesse,
and so to the heavenly powers I commend you. <i>Saladine</i>, having
taken his leave of all them that were with <i>Thorello</i>, returned
him this answer. Sir, it may one day hereafter so happen, as we shal
let you see some of our Marchandises, for the better confirmation
of your beleefe, and our profession.</p>

<p>Thus parted Signior <i>Thorello</i> and his friends, from <i>Saladine</i> and
his company, who verily determined in the heighth of his minde,
if he should be spared with life, and the warre (which he expected)
concluded: to requite <i>Thorello</i> with no lesse courtesie, then hee had
already declared to him; conferring a long while after with his
Baschaes, both of him and his beauteous Lady, not forgetting any
of their courteous actions, but gracing them all with deserved commendation.
But after they had (with very laborious paines) surveyed
most of the Westerne parts, they all tooke Shipping, and returned
into <i>Alexandria</i>: sufficiently informed, what preparation
was to be made for their owne defence. And Signior <i>Thorello</i> being
come backe againe to <i>Pavia</i>, consulted with his privat thoughts
(many times after) what these three travailers should be, but came
farre short of knowing the truth, till (by experience) hee became
better informed.</p>

<p>When the time was come, that the Christians were to make
their passage, and wonderfull great preparations, in all places performed:
Signiour <i>Thorello</i>, notwithstanding the teares and intreaties
of his Wife, determined to be one in so woorthy and honourable
a voyage: and having made his provision ready, nothing wanting
but mounting on Horsebacke, to go where he should take shipping;
to his Wife (whom he most intirely affected) thus hee spake.
Madame, I goe as thou seest in this famous Voyage, as well for
mine Honour, as also the benefite of my soule; all our goodes and
possessions, I commit to thy vertuous care. And because I am not
certaine of my returning backe againe, in regard of a thousand accidents
which may happen, in such a Countrey as I goe unto: I desire
onely but one favour of thee, whatsoever daunger shall befall
mee; Namely, when any certaine tydings shall be brought mee of
my death; to stay no longer before thy second marriage, but one
yeare, one month, and one day; to begin on this day of my departing
from thee.</p>

<p>The Lady, who wept exceedingly, thus answered. Alas Sir: I
know not how to carry my selfe, in such extremity of greefe, as now
you leave me; but if my life surmount the fortitude of sorrow, and
whatsoever shall happen to you for certainty, either life or death:
I will live and dye the Wife of Signiour <i>Thorello</i>, and make my obsequies
in his memory onely.</p>

<p>Not so Madame (replyed her Husband) not so; Be not overrash
in promising any thing, albeit I am well assured, that so much as
consisteth in thy strength, I make no question of thy performance.
But consider withall (deare heart) thou art a young woman, beautifull,
of great parentage, and no way thereto inferior in the blessings
of Fortune.</p>

<p>Thy Vertues are many, and universally both divulged and knowen,
in which respect, I make no doubt; but divers and sundrie
great Lords and Gentlemen (if but the least rumour of my death be
noysed) will make suite for thee to thy parents and brethren, from
whose violent solicitings, wouldst thou never so resolutely make resistance,
yet thou canst not be able to defend thy selfe; but whether
thou wilt or no, thou must yeeld to please them; and this is the only
reason, why I would tie thee to this limited time, and not one day
or minute longer.</p>

<p><i>Adalietta</i>, sweetly hugging him in her armes, and melting her
selfe in kisses, sighes, and teares on his face, said. Well Sir, I will do
so much as I am able, in this your most kinde and loving imposition:
and when I shall bee compelled to the contrary: yet rest thus
constantly assured, that I will not breake this your charge, so much
as in thought. Praying ever heartily to the heavenly powers, that
they will direct your course home againe to me, before your prefixed
date, or else I shall live in continuall languishing. In the knitting
up of this woful parting, embracing and kissing either infinite times,
the Lady tooke a Ring from off her finger, and giving it to her husband,
said. If I chaunce to die before I see you againe, remember
me when you looke on this. He receiving the Ring, and bidding all
the rest of his Friends farewell, mounted on horsebacke, and rode
away wel attended.</p>

<p>Being come unto <i>Geneway</i>, he and his company boorded a Galley,
and (in few dayes after) arrived at <i>Acres</i>, where they joyned
themselves with the Christian Army, wherein there happened a
verie dangerous mortality: During which time of so sharpe visitation
(the cause unknowne whence it proceeded) whether thorough
the industrie, or rather the good Fortune of <i>Saladine</i>, well-neere
all the rest of the Christians (which escaped death) were
surprized his prisoner (without a blow strucken) and sundred and
imprisoned in divers Townes and Citties. Amongest the which
number of prisoners, it was Signior <i>Thorelloes</i> chaunce to be one,
and walked in bonds to <i>Alexandria</i>, where being unknowne, and
fearing least he should be discovered: constrained thereto meerly
by necessity, hee shewed himselfe in the condition of a Faulconer;
wherein he was very excellently experienced, and by which means
his profession was made knowne to <i>Saladine</i>, hee delivered out of
prison, and created the Soldans Faulconer.</p>

<p><i>Thorello</i> (whom the Soldane called by no other name, then the
Christian, neyther of them knowing the other) sadly now remembred
his departure from <i>Pavia</i>, devising and practising many
times, how he might escape thence, but could not compasse it by any
possible meanes. Wherefore, certaine Ambassadours beeing
sent by the <i>Genewaye</i>, to redeeme divers Cittizens of theirs, there
detained as prisoners, and being ready to returne home againe: he
purposed to write to his Wife, that he was living, and wold repaire
to her so soone as he could, desiring the still continued rememberance
of her limited time. By close and cunning meanes hee wrote
the Letter, earnestly intreating one of the Ambassadors (who knew
him perfectly, but made no outward apparance thereof) to deale in
such sort for him, that the Letter might be delivered to the handes
of the Abbot <i>Di San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro</i>, who was (indeede) his
Uncle.</p>

<p>While <i>Thorello</i> remayned in this his Faulconers condition, it
fortuned uppon a day, that <i>Saladine</i>, conversing with him about
his Hawkes: <i>Thorello</i> chanced to smile, and used such a kinde of
gesture or motion with his Lippes, which <i>Saladine</i> (when he was in
his house at <i>Pavia</i>) had heedfully observed, and by this note, instantly
he remembred Signior <i>Thorello</i>, and began to eye him very
respectively, perswading himselfe that he was the same man. And
therefore falling from their former kinde of discoursing: Tell mee
Christian (quoth <i>Saladine</i>) what Country-man art thou of the
West? Sir, answered Signiour <i>Thorello</i>, I am by Country a Lombard,
borne in a City called <i>Pavia</i>, a poore man, and of as poore
condition.</p>

<p>So soone as <i>Saladine</i> had heard these Words; becomming assured
in that which (but now) he doubted, he saide within himselfe.
Now the Gods have given me time, wherein I may make knowne
to this man, how thankefully I accepted his kinde courtesie, and
cannot easily forget it. Then, without saying any thing else, causing
his Guard-robe to be set open, he tooke him with him thither,
and sayde. Christian, observe well all these Garments, and quicken
thy remembrance, in telling mee truly, whether thou hast seene
any of them before now, or no. Signiour <i>Thorello</i> looked on them
all advisedly, and espyed those two especiall Garments, which his
Wife had given one of the strange Merchants; yet he durst not credit
it, or that possibly it could be the same, neverthelesse he said. Sir,
I doe not know any of them, but true it is, that these two doe resemble
two such Robes, as I was wont to weare my selfe, and these
(or the like) were given to three Merchants, that happened to visite
my poore house.</p>

<p>Now could <i>Saladine</i> containe no longer, but embracing him
joyfullly in his armes, he said. You are Signior <i>Thorello d'Istria</i>, and
I am one of those three Merchants, to whom your Wife gave these
Roabes: and now the time is come to give you credible intelligence
of my Merchandise, as I promised at my departing from you, for
such a time (I told you) would come at length. <i>Thorello</i>, was both
glad, and bashfull together: glad, that he had entertained such a
Guest, and bashfully ashamed, that his welcome had not exceeded
in more bountifull manner. <i>Thorello</i>, replyed <i>Saladine</i>, seeing the
Gods have sent you so happily to me: account your selfe to be soly
Lord here, for I am now no more then a private man.</p>

<p>I am not able to expresse their counterchanges of courtesie, <i>Saladine</i>
commanding him to be cloathed in Royall garments, and
brought into the presence of his very greatest Lords, where having
spoken liberally in his due commendation, he commanded them
to honour him as himselfe, if they expected any grace or favour
from him, which every one did immediately, but (above all the rest)
those two Baschaes, which accompanied <i>Saladine</i> at his house. The
greatnesse of this pompe and glory, so suddenly throwne on Signior
<i>Thorello</i>, made him halfe forget all matters of <i>Lomberdie</i>; and
so much the rather, because he had no doubt at all, but that his letters,
were safely come to the hands of his Uncle.</p>

<p>Here I am to tell you, that in the Campe or Army of the Christians,
on the day when <i>Saladine</i> made his surprizall, there was a
Provinciall Gentleman dead and buried, who was Signior <i>Thorello
de Dignes</i>, a man of very honourable and great esteeme, in which
respect (Signior <i>Thorello d'Istria</i>, knowne throughout the Army, by
his Nobility and valour) whosoever heard that Signior <i>Thorello</i>
was dead: beleeved it to be <i>Thorello d'Istria</i>, and not he of <i>Dignes</i>,
so that <i>Thorello d'Istriaes</i> unknowne surprizall and thraldome, made
it also to passe for an assured truth.</p>

<p>Beside, many Italians returning home, and carrying this report
for credible; some were so audaciously presumptuous, as they avouched
upon their oathes, that not onely they saw him dead, but
were present at his buriall likewise. Which rumour comming to
the eare of his Wife, and likewise to his kinred and hers: procured
a great and grievous mourning among them, and all that happened
to heare thereof.</p>

<p>Over-tedious time it would require, to relate at large, the publique
griefe and sorrow, with the continuall lamentations of his
Wife, who (within some few moneths after) became tormented
with new marriage solicitings, before she had halfe sighed for the
first: the very greatest persons of <i>Lomberdie</i> making the motion,
being daily followed and furthered by her owne brothers and
friends. Still (drowned in teares) she returned denyall, till in the
end, when no contradiction could prevaile, to satisfie her parents,
and the importunate pursuers: she was constrained to reveale, the
charge imposed on her by her Husband, which shee had vowed infallibly
to keepe, and till that very time, she would in no wise consent.</p>

<p>While wooing for a second wedding with <i>Adalietta</i>, proceeded
in this manner at <i>Pavia</i>, it chanced on a day, that Signior <i>Thorello</i>
had espied a man in <i>Alexandria</i>, whom he saw with the <i>Geneway</i>
Ambassadours, when they set thence towards <i>Geneway</i> with
their Gallies. And causing him to be sent for, he demaunded of
him, the successe of the voyage, and when the Gallies arrived at <i>Geneway</i>;
whereto he returned him this answere. My Lord, our Gallies
made a very fatall voyage, as it is (already) too well knowne in
<i>Creete</i>, where my dwelling is. For when we drew neere <i>Sicilie</i>,
there suddenly arose a very dangerous North-West-winde, which
drove us on the quicke-Sands of <i>Barbarie</i>, where not any man escaped
with life, onely my selfe excepted, but (in the wracke) two of
my brethren perished.</p>

<p>Signior <i>Thorello</i>, giving credit to the mans words, because they
were most true indeed, and remembring also, that the time limitted
to his Wife, drew neere expiring within very few dayes, and no
newes now possibly to be sent thither of his life, his Wife would
questionlesse be marryed againe: he fell into such a deepe conceited
melancholly, as food and sleepe forsooke him, whereupon, he
kept his bed, setting downe his peremptory resolution for death.
When <i>Saladine</i> (who dearely loved him) heard thereof, he came in
all haste to see him, and having (by many earnest perswasions and
entreaties) understood the cause of his melancholly and sickenesse:
he very severely reproved him, because he could no sooner acquaint
him therewith. Many kind and comfortable speeches, he
gave him, with constant assurance, that (if he were so minded) he
would so order the businesse for him; as he should be at <i>Pavia</i>, by
the same time as he had appointed to his Wife, and revealed to him
also the manner how.</p>

<p><i>Thorello</i> verily beleeved the <i>Soldanes</i> promise, because he had
often heard the possibility of performance, and others had effected
as much, divers times else-where: whereupon he began to comfort
himselfe, soliciting the <i>Soldan</i> earnestly that it might be accomplished.
<i>Saladine</i> sent for one of his Sorcerers (of whose skill he had
formerly made experience) to take a direct course, how Signior
<i>Thorello</i> should be carryed (in one night) to <i>Pavia</i>, and being in his
bed. The Magitian undertooke to doe it, but, for the Gentlemans
more ease, he must first be possessed with an entraunced dead sleep.
<i>Saladine</i> being thus assured of the deeds full effecting, he came againe
to <i>Thorello</i>, and finding him to be setled for <i>Pavia</i> (if possibly
it might be accomplished by the determined time, or else no other
expectation but death) he said unto him as followeth.</p>

<p>Signior <i>Thorello</i>, if with true affection you love your Wife, and
misdoubt her marriage to some other man: I protest unto you, by
the supreme powers, that you deserve no reprehension in any
manner whatsoever. For, of all the Ladyes that ever I have seene,
she is the onely woman, whose carriage, vertues, and civile speaking
(setting aside beauty, which is but a fading flower) deserveth most
graciously to be respected, much more to be affected in the highest
degree. It were to me no meane favour of our Gods, (seeing Fortune
directed your course so happily hither) that for the short or
long time we have to live, we might reigne equally together in
these Kingdomes under my subjection. But if such grace may not
be granted me, yet, seeing it stands mainly upon the perill of your
life, to be at <i>Pavia</i> againe by your own limitted time, it is my chiefest
comfort, that I am therewith acquainted, because I intended to
have you conveighed thither, yea, even into your owne house, in
such honourable order as your vertues doe justly merit, which in
regard it cannot be so conveniently performed, but as I have already
informed you, and as the necessity of the case urgently commandeth;
accept it as it may be best accomplished.</p>

<p>Great <i>Saladine</i> (answered <i>Thorello</i>) effects (without words) have
already sufficiently warranted your Gracious disposition towards
me, farre beyond any requitall remayning in me; your word onely
being enough for my comfort in this case, either dying or living.
But in regard you have taken such order for my departure hence,
I desire to have it done with all possible expedition, because to morrow
is the very last day, that I am to be absent. <i>Saladine</i> protested
that it should be done, and the same evening in the great Hall of
his Pallace, commanded a rich and costly Bedde to be set up, the
mattras formed after the <i>Alexandrian</i> manner, of Velvet and cloth
Gold, the Quilts, counter-points and coverings, sumptuously imbroydered
with Orient Pearles and Precious Stones, supposed to
be of inestimable value, and two rarely wrought Pillowes, such as
best beseemed so stately a Bedde, the Curtaines and Vallans every
way equall to the other pompe.</p>

<p>Which being done, he commanded that <i>Thorello</i> (who was indifferently
recovered) should be attyred in one of his owne sumptuous
<i>Saracine</i> Roabes, the very fairest and richest that ever was
seene, and on his head a Majesticall Turbant, after the manner of
his owne wearing, and the houre appearing to be somewhat late, he
with many of his best Baschaes, went to the Chamber where <i>Thorello</i>
was, and sitting downe a while by him, in teares thus he spake.
Signior <i>Thorello</i>, the houre for sundering you and me, is now very
neere, and because I cannot beare you company, in regard of the
businesse you goe about, and which by no meanes will admit it:
I am to take my leave of you in this Chamber, and therefore am
purposely come to doe it. But before I bid you farewell, let me
entreat you, by the love and friendship confirmed betweene us, to
be mindfull of me, and to take such order (your affaires being fully
finished in <i>Lombardie</i>) that I may once more enjoy the sight of you
here, for a mutuall solace and satisfaction of our mindes, which are
now divided by this urgent hast. Till which may be granted, let
me want no visitation of your kind letters, commanding thereby of
me, whatsoever here can possibly be done for you; assuring your
selfe, no man living can command me as you doe.</p>

<p>Signior <i>Thorello</i> could not forbeare weeping, but being much
hindred thereby, answered in few words. That he could not possibly
forget, his Gracious favours and extraordinary benefits used towards
him, but would accomplish whatsoever hee commaunded,
according as heaven did enable him.</p>

<p>Hereupon, <i>Saladine</i> embracing him, and kissing his forehead,
said. All my Gods goe with you, and guard you from any perill,
departing so out of the Chamber weeping, and his Baschaes (having
likewise taken their leave of <i>Thorello</i>) followed <i>Saladine</i> into
the Hall, whereas the Bedde stood readily prepared. Because
it waxed very late, and the Magitian also there attending for his
dispatch: the Phisitian went with the potion to <i>Thorello</i>, and
perswading him, in the way of friendship, that it was onely to
strengthen him after his great Weaknes: he drank it off, being thereby
immediately entraunced, and so presently sleeping, was (by
<i>Saladines</i> command) laid on the sumptuous and costly Bed, whereon
stood an Imperiall Crowne of infinite value, appearing
(by a description engraven on it) that <i>Saladine</i> sent it to Madame
<i>Adalietta</i>, the wife of <i>Thorello</i>. On his finger also hee put a Ring,
wherein was enchased an admirable Carbuncle, which seemed like
a flaming Torche, the value thereof not to bee estimated. By him
likewise hee laid a rich sword, with the girdle, hangers, and other
furniture, such as seldome can be seene the like. Then hee laid a
Jewell on the Pillow by him, so sumptuouslie embelished with
Pearles and precious Stones, as might have beseemed the greatest
Monarch in the World to weare. Last of all, on either side
of them, hee set two great Basons of pure Gold, full of double
ducates, many cords of Orient Pearles, Rings, Girdles, and other
costly Jewells (over-tedious to bee recounted) and kissing him
once more as hee lay in the bedde, commanded the Magitian to dispatch
and be gone.</p>

<p>Instantly, the bedde and <i>Thorello</i> in it, in the presence of <i>Saladine</i>,
was invisibly carried thence, and while he sate conferring with his
Baschaes, the bed, Signior <i>Thorello</i>, and all the rich Jewells about
him, was transported and set in the Church of <i>San Pietro in Ciel
d'Ore</i> in <i>Pavia</i>, according to his own request, and soundly sleeping,
being placed directly before the high Altar. Afterward, when the
bells rung to Mattines, the Sexton entring the Church with a light
in his hand (where hee beheld a light of greater splendor) and suddenly
espied the sumptuous bedde there standing: not only was he
smitten into admiration, but hee ranne away also very fearefully.
When the Abbot and the Monkes mette him thus running into the
Cloyster, they became amazed, and demanded the reason why he
ranne in such haste, which the Sexton told them. How? quoth the
Abbot, thou art no childe, or a new-come hither, to be so easilie
affrighted in our holy Church, where Spirits can have no power
to walke, God and Saint <i>Peter</i> (wee hope) are stronger for us then
them so: wherefore turne backe with us, and let us see the cause of
thy feare.</p>

<p>Having lighted many Torches, the Abbot and his Monkes entred
with the Sexton into the Church, where they beheld the
wonderfull riche bedde, and the Knight lying fast a-sleepe in it.
While they stood all in amazement, not daring to approach neere
the bedde, whereon lay such costly Jewells: it chanced that Signior
<i>Thorello</i> awaked, and breathed forth a vehement sigh. The
Monkes and the Abbot seeing him to stirre, ranne all away in feare,
crying aloud, God and S. <i>Peter</i> defend us.</p>

<p>By this time <i>Thorello</i> had opened his eyes, and looking round about
him, perceived that hee was in the place of <i>Saladines</i> promise,
whereof hee was not a little joyfulll. Wherefore, sitting up in the
bedde, and particularly observing all the things about him: albeit
he knew sufficiently the magnificence of <i>Saladine</i>, yet now it appeared
far greater to him, and imagined more largely thereof, then hee
could doe before. But yet, without any other ceremony, seeing the
flight of the Monkes, hearing their cry, and perceiving the reason;
he called the Abbot by his name, desiring him not to be affraid, for
he was his Nephew <i>Thorello</i>, and no other.</p>

<p>When the Abbot heard this, hee was ten times worse affrighted
then before, because (by publique fame) hee had beene so many
moneths dead and buried; but receiving (by true arguments) better
assurance of him, and hearing him still call him by his name:
blessing himselfe with the signe of the Crosse, hee went somewhat
neerer to the bed, when <i>Thorello</i> said. My loving Uncle, and religious
holy Father, whereof are you affraid? I am your loving Nephew,
newly returned from beyond the Seas. The Abbot, seeing his beard
to be grown long, and his habit after the Arabian fashion, did yet
collect some resemblance of his former countenance; and being
better perswaded of him, tooke him by the hand, saying:</p>

<p>Sonne thou art happily returned, yet there is not any man in our
Citie, but doth verily beleeve thee to bee dead, and therefore
doe not much wonder at our feare. Moreover, I dare assure thee,
that thy Wife <i>Adalietta</i>, being conquered by the controuling command,
and threatnings of her kinred (but much against her owne
minde) is this very morning to be married to a new husband, and
the marriage feast is solemnly prepared, in honour of this second
nuptialls.</p>

<p><i>Thorello</i> arising out of the bedde, gave gracious salutations to the
Abbot and his Monkes, intreating earnestly of them all, that no
word might be spoken of his returne, untill he had compleated an
important businesse. Afterward, having safely secured the bedde,
and all the rich Jewells, he fully acquainted the Abbot with all his
passed fortunes, whereof he was immeasurably joyfullly, &amp; having
satisfied him, concerning the new elected husband, <i>Thorello</i> said unto
the Abbot. Uncle, before any rumour of my returne, I would
gladly see my wives behaviour at this new briding feast, &amp; although
men of religion are seldome seene at such Joviall meetings: yet (for
my sake) doe you so order the matter, that I (as an Arabian stranger)
may be a guest under your protection; whereto the Abbot very
gladly condescended.</p>

<p>In the morning, he sent to the Bridegroom, and advertised him,
that he (with a stranger newly arrived) intented to dine with him,
which the Gentleman accepted in thankefull manner. And when
dinner time came, <i>Thorello</i> in his strange disguise went with the
Abbot to the Bridegroomes house, where he was lookt on with admiration
of all the guests, but not knowne or suspected by any one;
because the Abbot reported him to be a <i>Sarracine</i>, and sent by the
Soldane (in Ambassage) to the King of France. <i>Thorello</i> was seated
at a by-table, but directly opposite to the new Bride, whom hee
much delighted to looke on, and easily collected by her sad countenance,
that shee was scarcely well pleased with this new nuptialls.
She likewise beheld him very often, not in regard of any knowledge
she took of him: for the bushiness of his beard, strangeness of habit,
(but most of all) firm beleefe of his death, was the maine prevention.</p>

<p>At such time as <i>Thorello</i> thought it convenient, to approve how
farre he was falne out of her remembrance; he took the ring which
she gave him at his departure, and calling a young Page that waited
on none but the Bride, said to him in Italian: Faire youth, goe to
the Bride, and saluting her from me, tell her, it is a custome observed
in my Country, that when any Stranger (as I am heere) sitteth
before a new married Bride, as now shee is, in signe that hee is welcome
to her feast, she sendeth the same Cup (wherein she drinketh
her selfe) full of the best wine, and when the stranger hath drunke
so much as him pleaseth, the Bride then pledgeth him with all the
rest. The Page delivered the message to the Bride, who, being a
woman of honourable disposition, and reputing him to be a Noble
Gentleman, to testifie that his presence there was very acceptable to
her, shee commanded a faire Cuppe of gold (which stood directlie
before her) to bee neately washed, and when it was filled with
excellent Wine, caused it to bee carried to the stranger, and so it
was done.</p>

<p><i>Thorello</i> having drunke a heartie draught to the Bride, conveyed
the Ring into the Cuppe, before any person could perceive it,
and having left but small store of Wine in it, covered the Cuppe,
and sent it againe to the Bride, who received it very graciously,
and to honour the Stranger in his Countries custome, dranke up
the rest of the Wine, and espying the Ring, shee tooke it forth undetected
by any: Knowing it to be the same Ring which shee gave
Signior <i>Thorello</i> at his parting from her; she fixed her eyes often on
it, &amp; as often on him, whom she thought to be a stranger, the cheerfull
bloud mounting up into her cheeks, and returning againe with
remembrance to her heart, that (howsoever thus disguised) he only
was her husband.</p>

<p>Like one of <i>Bacchus</i> Froes, up furiously she started, and throwing
downe the Table before her, cried out aloud: This is my Lord
and Husband, this truely is my Lord <i>Thorello</i>. So running to the
Table where he sate, without regard of all the riches thereon, down
she threw it likewise, and clasping her armes about his necke, hung
so mainly on him (weeping, sobbing, and kissing him) as she could
not be taken off by any of the company, nor shewed any moderation
in this excesse of passion, till <i>Thorello</i> spake, and entreated her
to be more patient, because this extremity was over-dangerous for
her. Thus was the solemnitie much troubled, but every one there
very glad and joyfulll for the recovery of such a famous and worthy
Knight, who intreated them all to vouchsafe him silence, and so related
all his fortunes to them, from the time of his departure, to the
instant houre. Concluding withall, that hee was no way offended
with the new Bride-groome, who upon the so constant report of
his death, deserved no blame in making election of his wife.</p>

<p>The Bridegroome, albeit his countenance was somewhat cloudie,
to see his hope thus disappointed: yet granted freely, that <i>Adalietta</i>
was <i>Thorello's</i> wife in equitie, and hee could not justly lay any
claime to her. She also resigned the Crown and Rings which she
had so lately received of her new Spouse, and put that on her finger
which she found in the Cup, and that Crowne was set upon her
head, in honour sent her from great <i>Saladine</i>. In which triumphant
manner, she left the new Bridegrooms abiding, and repayred home
to <i>Thorello's</i> house, with such pompe and magnificence as never
had the like been seene in <i>Pavia</i> before, all the Citizens esteeming
it as a miracle, that they had so happily recovered Signior <i>Thorello</i>
againe.</p>

<p>Some part of the Jewells he gave to him, who had beene at cost
with the marriage feasting, and some to his Uncle the Abbot, beside
a bountie bestowed on the Monkes. Then he sent a messenger
to <i>Saladine</i>, with Letters of his whole successe, and confessing himselfe
(for ever) his obliged servant: living many yeeres (after) with
his wife <i>Adalietta</i>, and using greater curtesies to strangers, then ever
before he had done.</p>

<p>In this manner ended the troubles of Signior <i>Thorello</i>, and the afflictions
of his dearely affected Lady, with due recompence to their
honest and ready courtesies. Many strive (in outward shew) to doe
the like, who although they are sufficiently able, doe performe it so
basely, as it rather redoundeth to their shame, then honour. And
therefore if no merit ensue thereon, but onely such disgrace as justly
should follow; let them lay the blame upon themselves.</p>

<h2>The Tenth Novell.</h2>

<h4><i>Set downe as an example or warning to all wealthie men, how to have
care of marrying themselves. And likewise to poore and meane women,
to be patient in their fortunes, and obedient to their husbands.</i></h4>


<p>Questionlesse, the Kings Novell did not so much exceed the
rest in length, but it proved as pleasing to the whole assembly,
&amp; past with their generall approbation, till <i>Dioneus</i> (in
a merry jesting humour) said. The plaine honest simple man, that
stood holding the Candle, to see the setting on of his Mules tayle;
deserved two penny-worth of more praise, then all our applauding
of Signior <i>Thorello</i>: And knowing himselfe to bee left for the last
speaker, thus he began.</p>

<p>Milde &amp; modest Ladies, for ought I can perceive to the contrary,
this day was dedicated to none but Kings, Soldanes, and great Potentates,
not in favour of any inferiour or meaner persons. And
therefore, because I would be loth to dis-ranke my selfe from the
rest, I purpose to speake of a Lord Marquesse, not any matter of
great magnificence, but rather in a more humble nature, and sorted
to an honest end: which yet I will not advise any to immitate, because
(perhaps) they cannot so well digest it, as they did whom my
Novell concerneth; thus then I begin.</p>

<p>It is a great while since, when among those that were Lord Marquesses
of <i>Saluzzo</i>, the very greatest and worthiest man of them al,
was a young Noble Lord, named <i>Gualtiero</i>, who having neyther
wife nor childe, spent his time in nothing else but hawking &amp; hunting:
nor had he any minde of marriage, or to enjoy the benefit of
children, wherein many did repute him the wiser. But this being
distastfull to his subjects, they very often earnestly solicited him, to
match himselfe with a wife, to the end, that hee might not decease
without an heire, nor they be left destitute of a succeeding Lord;
offering themselves to provide him of such a one, so well descended
by Father and Mother, as not only should confirm their hope,
but also yeeld him high contentment; whereto the Lord Marquess
thus answered.</p>

<p>Worthie friends, you would constraine me to the thing, wherewith
I never had any intent to meddle, considering, how difficult
a case it is to meet with such a woman, who can agree with a man in
all his conditions, and how great the number is of them, who daily
happen on the contrarie: but most (and worst of all the rest) how
wretched and miserable prooves the life of man, who is bound to
live with a wife not fit for him. And in saying, you can learn to understand
the custome and qualities of children, by behaviour of the
fathers and mothers, and so to provide mee of a wife, it is a meere
argument of folly: for neither shall I comprehend, or you either,
the secret inclinations of parents; I meane of the Father, and much
lesse the complexion of the mother. But admitte it were within
compasse of power to know them; yet it is a frequent sight, and
observed every day; that daughters doe resemble neither father
nor mother, but that they are naturally governed by their owne
instinct.</p>

<p>But because you are so desirous to have me fettered in the chains
of wedlocke; I am contented to grant what you request. And because
I would have no complaint made of any but my selfe, if matters
should not happen answerable to expectation; I will make mine
owne eyes my electors, and not see by any others sight. Giving
you this assurance before, that if she whom I shall make choice of,
be not of you honoured and respected as your Lady and Mistresse:
it will ensue to your detriment, how much you have displeased me,
to take a wife at your request, and against mine owne will.</p>

<p>The Noble men answered, that they were well satisfied, provided
that he tooke a wife.</p>

<p>Some indifferent space of time before, the beauty, manners, and
well-seeming vertues, of a poore Countrie-mans daughter, dwelling
in no farre distant village, had appeared very pleasing to the
Lord Marquesse, and gave him full perswasion, that with her hee
should lead a comfortable life. And therefore without any further
search or inquisition, he absolutely resolved to marry her, and having
conferred with her Father, agreed, that his daughter should be
his wife. Whereupon, the Marquesse made a generall
Convocation of all his Lords, Barons, and other of his especiall
friends, from all parts of his Dominion; and when they were
assembled together, hee then spake unto them in manner as followeth.</p>

<p>Honourable friends, it appeared pleasing to you all; and yet (I
thinke) you are of the same minde, that I should dispose my selfe to
take a wife: and I thereto condescended, more to yeeld you contentment,
then for any particular desire in my selfe. Let mee now
remember you of your solemne made promise, with full consent to
honour and obey her (whosoever) as your Soveraigne Lady and Mistresse,
that I shall elect to make my wife: and now the time is come,
for my exacting the performance of that promise, and which I look
you must constantly keepe. I have made choyce of a young virgine,
answerable to mine owne heart and liking, dwelling not farre off
hence, whom I intend to make my wife, and (within few daies) to
have her brought home to my Pallace. Let your care and diligence
then extend so farre, as to see that the feast may be sumptuous, and
her entertainment to bee most honourable: to the end that I may
receive as much contentment in your promise performed, as you
shall perceive I doe in my choice.</p>

<p>The Lords and all the rest, were wondrously joyfulll to heare him
so well inclined, expressing no lesse by their shouts and jocund suffrages:
protesting cordially, that she should be welcommed with
pompe and majestie, and honoured of them all, as their Liege Ladie
and Soveraigne. Afterward, they made preparation for a
princely and magnificent feast, as the Marquesse did the like, for a
marriage of extraordinary state and qualitie, inviting all his kinred,
friends, and acquaintance in all parts and Provinces, about him.
Hee made also readie most riche and costly garments, shaped by
the body of a comely young Gentlewoman, who he knew to be equall
in proportion and stature, to her of whom hee hade made his
election.</p>

<p>When the appointed nuptiall day was come, the Lord Marques,
about nine of the clocke in the morning, mounted on horse-backe,
as all the rest did, who came to attend him honourably, and
having all things in due readinesse with them, he said: Lords, it is
time for us to goe fetch the Bride. So on hee rode with his traine,
to the same poore Village whereas shee dwelt, and when hee was
come to her Fathers house, hee saw the maiden returning very hastily
from a Well, where shee had beene to fetch a paile of Water,
which shee set downe, and stood (accompanied with other maidens)
to see the passage by of the Lord Marquesse and his traine.
<i>Gualtiero</i> called her by her name, which was <i>Grizelda</i>, and asked
her, where her Father was: who bashfully answered him, and with
an humble courtesie, saying. My gracious Lord, hee is in the
house.</p>

<p>Then the Marquesse dismounted from his horse, commanding
every one to attend him, then all alone hee entred into the poore
Cottage, where he found the maides father, being named <i>Janiculo</i>,
and said unto him. God speed good Father, I am come to espouse
thy daughter <i>Grizelda</i>: but first I have a few demands to make,
which I will utter to her in thy presence. Then hee turned to the
maide, and saide.</p>

<p>Faire <i>Grizelda</i>, if I make you my wife, will you doe your best
endeavour to please me, in all things which I shall doe or say? will
you also be gentle, humble, and patient? with divers other the like
questions: whereto she still answered, that she would, so neere as
heaven (with grace) should enable her.</p>

<p>Presently he tooke her by the hand, so led her forth of the poore
homely house, and in the presence of all his company, with his
owne hands, he took off her meane wearing garments, smocke and
all, and cloathed her with those Robes of State which he had purposely
brought thither for her, and plaiting her haire over her
shoulders, hee placed a Crowne of gold on her head, whereat every
one standing as amazed, and wondring not a little, hee said:
<i>Grizelda</i>, wilt thou have me to thy husband. Modestly blushing,
and kneeling on the ground, she answered. Yes my gracious Lord,
if you will accept so poore a maiden to be your wife. Yes <i>Grizelda</i>,
quoth hee, with this holy kisse, I confirme thee for my wife; and
so espoused her before them all. Then mounting her on a milke-white
Palfray, brought thither for her, shee was thus honourably
conducted to her Pallace.</p>

<p>Now concerning the marriage feast and triumphes, they were
performed with no lesse pompe, then if she had beene daughter to
the King of France. And the young Bride apparantly declared,
that (with her garments) her minde and behaviour were quite changed.
For indeed shee was (as it were shame to speake otherwise) a
rare creature, both of person and perfections, and not onely was
shee absolute for beautie, but so sweetely amiable, gracious, and
goodlie; as if she were not the daughter of poore <i>Janiculo</i>, and a
Countrie Shepheardesse, but rather of some Noble Lord, whereat
every one wondred that formerly had knowne her. Beside all
this, shee was so obedient to her husband, so fervent in all dutifull
offices, and patient, without the very least provoking: as hee held
himselfe much more then contented, and the onely happy man of
the world.</p>

<p>In like manner, towards the subjects of her Lord and Husband,
she shewed her selfe alwayes so benigne and gracious; as there was
not any one, but the more they lookt on her, the better they loved
her, honouring her voluntarily, and praying to the heavens, for her
health, dignity and well-fares long continuance. Speaking now
(quite contrary to their former opinion of the Marquesse) honourably
and worthily, that he had shewne him selfe a singular wise
man, in the election of his Wife, which few else (but he) in the
world would have done: because their judgement might fall farre
short, of discerning those great and precious vertues, veiled under
a homely habite, and obscured in a poore Countrey cottage. To
be briefe, in very short time, not onely the Marquisate it selfe, but
all neighbouring Provinces round about, had no other common
talke, but of her rare course of life, devotion, charity, and all good
actions else; quite quailing all sinister Instructions of her Husband,
before he received her in marriage.</p>

<p>About foure or five yeeres after the birth of her daughter, shee
conceived with child againe, and (at the limitted houre of deliverance)
had a goodly Sonne, to the no little liking of the Marquesse.
Afterward, a strange humour entred into his braine, namely,
that by a long continued experience, and courses of intollerable
quality; he would needes make proofe of his faire Wives patience.
First he began to provoke her by injurious speeches, shewing fierce
and frowning lookes to her, intimating; that his people grew displeased
with him, in regard of his Wives base birth and education,
and so much the rather, because she was likely to bring children,
who (by her blood) were no better then beggars, and murmured at
the daughter already borne. Which words when <i>Grizelda</i> heard,
without any alteration of countenance, for the least distemperature
in any appearing action she said.</p>

<p>My honourable and gracious Lord, dispose of me, as you thinke
best, for your owne dignity and contentment, for I shall therewith
be well pleased: as she that knowes her selfe, farre inferiour to the
meanest of your people, much lesse worthy of the honour, whereto
you liked to advance me.</p>

<p>This answere was very welcome to the Marquesse, as apparantly
perceiving hereby, that the dignity whereto hee had exalted her,
or any particular favours beside, could not infect her with any
pride, coynesse, or disdaine. Not long after, having told her in plaine
and open speeches, that his subjects could not endure her so late
borne daughter: he called a trusty servant of his, and having instructed
him what he should doe, sent him to <i>Grizelda</i>, and he being alone
with her, looking very sadde, and much perplexed in mind, he
saide. Madame, except I intend to loose mine owne life,
I must accomplish what my Lord hath strictly enjoyned me, which
is, to take this your young daughter, and then I must: So breaking
off abruptly, the Lady hearing his words, and noting his frowning
lookes, remembring also what the Marquesse himselfe had formerly
said; she presently imagined, that he had commanded his servant
to kill the childe. Suddenly therefore, she tooke it out of the
Cradle, and having sweetly kissed, and bestowne her blessing on it
(albeit her heart throbbed, with the inward affection of a Mother)
without any alteration of countenance, she tenderly laid it in the
servants armes, and said. Here friend, take it, and doe with it as thy
Lord and mine hath commanded thee: but leave it in no rude
place, where birds or savage beasts may devoure it, except it be his
will to have it so.</p>

<p>The servant departing from her with the child, and reporting
to the Marquesse what his Lady had said; he wondered at her incomparable
constancy. Then he sent it by the same servant to
<i>Bologna</i>, to an honourable Lady his kinsewoman, requesting her
(without revealing whose child it was) to see it both nobly and carefully
educated.</p>

<p>At time convenient afterward, being with child againe, and delivered
of a Princely Sonne (then which nothing could be more
joyfulll to the Marquesse) yet all this was not sufficient for him; but
with farre ruder language then before, and lookes expressing harsh
intentions, he said unto her. <i>Grizelda</i>, though thou pleasest me
wonderfully, by the birth of this Princely Boy, yet my subjects are
not therewith contented, but blunder abroad maliciously; that the
grand-child of <i>Janiculo</i>, a poore countrey pezant, when I am dead
and gone, must be their Soveraigne Lord and Master. Which
makes me stand in feare of their expulsion, and to prevent that, I
must be rid of this childe, as well as the other, and then send thee
away from hence, that I may take another wife, more pleasing to
them.</p>

<p><i>Grizelda</i>, with a patient sufferent soule, hearing what he had said,
returned no other answere but this. Most Gracious and Honourable
Lord, satisfie and please your owne Royall minde, and never
use any respect of me: for nothing is precious or pleasing to mee,
but what may agree with your good liking. Within a while after,
the Noble Marquesse in the like manner as he did before for the
Daughter, so he sent the same servant for the Sonne, and seeming
as if he had sent it to have been slaine, conveighed it to be nursed at
<i>Bologna</i>, in company of his sweete Sister. Whereat the Lady
shewed no other discontentment in any kinde, then formerly
she had done for her Daughter, to the no meane marvell of the
Marquesse, who protested in his soule, that the like woman was
not in all the world beside. And were it not for his heedfull observation,
how loving and carefull she was of her children, prizing
them as dearely as her owne life: rash opinion might have perswaded
him, that she had no more in her, then a carnall affection,
not caring how many she had, so shee might thus easily be rid of
them; but he knew her to be a truely vertuous mother, and wisely
liable to endure his severest impositions.</p>

<p>His Subjects beleeving, that he had caused the children to bee
slaine, blamed him greatly, thought him to be a most cruell man,
and did highly compassionate the Ladies case: who when shee
came in company of other Gentlewomen, which mourned for
their deceased children, would answere nothing else: but that
they could not be more pleasing to her, then they were to the father
that begot them.</p>

<p>Within certaine yeares after the birth of these children, the
Marquesse purposed with himselfe, to make his last and finall
proofe of faire <i>Grizeldaes</i> patience, and said to some neere about
him: that he could no longer endure, to keepe <i>Grizelda</i> as his wife,
confessing, he had done foolishly, and according to a young giddie
braine, when he was so rash in the marriage of her. Wherefore he
would send to the Pope, and purchase a dispensation from him,
to repudiate <i>Grizelda</i>, and take another Wife. Wherein although
they greatly reproved him; yet he told them plainely, that it must
needes be so.</p>

<p>The Lady hearing these newes, and thinking she must returne againe
to her poore fathers house, and (perhaps) to her old occupation
of keeping sheepe, as in her younger dayes she had done, understanding
withall, that another woman must enjoy him, whom shee
dearely loved and honoured; you may well thinke (worthy Ladies)
that her patience was now put to the maine proofe indeede. Neverthelesse,
as with an invincible true vertuous courage, she had outstood
all the other injuries of Fortune; so did she constantly settle
her soule, to beare this with an undaunted countenance and behaviour.</p>

<p>At such time as was prefixed for the purpose, counterfeit Letters
came to the Marquesse (as sent from <i>Rome</i>) which he caused to be
publikely read in the hearing of his subjects: that the Pope had dispensed
with him, to leave <i>Griselda</i>, and marry with another Wife,
wherefore, sending for her immediately, in presence of them all, thus
he spake to her. Woman, by concession sent me from the Pope,
he hath dispensed with me, to make choyce of another Wife, and
to free my selfe from thee. And because my predecessors have
beene Noblemen, and great Lords in this Country, thou being the
daughter of a poore Countrey Clowne, and their blood and mine
notoriously imbased, by my marriage with thee; I intend to have
thee no longer my Wife, but will returne thee home to thy Fathers
house, with all the rich Dowry thou broughtest me; and then I wil
take another Wife, with whom I am already contracted, better
beseeming my birth, and farre more contenting and pleasing to my
people.</p>

<p>The Lady hearing these words (not without much paine and
difficulty) restrayned her teares, quite contrary to the naturall inclination
of women, and thus answered. Great Marquesse, I never
was so empty of discretion, but did alwayes acknowledge, that my
base and humble condition, could not in any manner sute with
your high blood and Nobility, and my being with you, I ever acknowledged,
to proceed from heaven and you, not any merit of
mine, but onely as a favour lent me, which you being now pleased
to recall backe againe, I ought to be pleased (and so am) that it bee
restored. Here is the Ring, wherewith you Espoused me; here (in
all humility) I deliver it to you. You command me, to carry home
the marriage Dowry which I brought with me: there is no need
of a Treasurer to repay it me, neither any new purse to carry it in,
much lesse any Sumpter to be laden with it. For (Noble Lord) it
was never out of my memory, that you tooke me starke naked;
and if it shall seeme sightly to you, that this body which hath borne
two children, and begotten by you, must againe be seene naked;
willingly must I depart hence naked. But I humbly beg of your
Excellency, in recompence of my Virginity, which I brought you
blamelesse, so much as in thought: that I may have but one of my
wedding Smocks, onely to conceale the shame of nakednesse, and
then I depart rich enough.</p>

<p>The Marquesse whose heart wept bloody teares, as his eyes
would likewise gladly have yeelded their naturall tribute; covered
all with a dissembled angry countenance, and starting up, said. Goe,
give her a Smocke onely, and so send her gadding. All there present
about him, entreated him to let her have a petticote, because it
might not be said, that she who had been his Wife thirteene yeares
and more, was sent away so poorely in her Smocke: but all their
perswasions prevailed not with him. Naked in her Smocke, without
hose or shooes, bareheaded, and not so much as a Cloth about
her necke, to the great griefe and mourning of all that saw her, she
went home to her old fathers house.</p>

<p>And he (good man) never beleeving, that the Marquesse would
long keepe his daughter as his Wife, but rather expected daily,
what now had happened: safely laid up the garments, whereof the
Marquesse despoyled her, the same morning when he espoused her.
Wherefore he delivered them to her, and she fell to her fathers
houshold businesse, according as formerly she had done; sustayning
with a great and unconquerable spirit, all the cruell assaults of
her enemy Fortune.</p>

<p>About such time after, as suted with his owne disposition, the
Marquesse made publiquely knowne to his subjects, that he meant
to joyne in marriage again, with the daughter to one of the Counts
of <i>Panago</i>, and causing preparation to be made for a sumptuous
wedding; he sent for <i>Grizelda</i>, and she being come, thus he spake
to her. The Wife that I have made the new election of, is to arrive
here within very few dayes, and at her first comming, I would
have her to be most honourably entertained. Thou knowest I have
no women in my house, that can decke up the Chambers, and set
all requisite things in due order, befitting for so solemne a Feast:
and therefore I sent for thee, who knowing (better then any other)
all the partes, provision and goods in the house, set every thing in
such order, as thou shalt thinke necessary.</p>

<p>Invite such Ladies and Gentlewomen as thou wilt, and give
them welcome, even as if thou wert the Lady of the house: and
when the marriage is ended, returne then home to thy father againe.</p>

<p>Although these words pierced like wonding daggers, the heart
of poore (but Noble patient) <i>Grizelda</i>, as being unable to forget
the unequal'd love she bare to the Marquesse, though the dignitie
of her former fortune, more easily slipt out of her remembrance;
yet neverthelesse, thus she answered.</p>

<p>My Gracious Lord, I am glad I can doe you any service; wherein
you shall find mee both willing and ready. In the same poore
garments, as she came from her fathers house, (although shee was
turned out in her Smocke) she began to sweep and make cleane the
Chambers, rubbe the stooles and benches in the Hall, and ordered
every in the Kitchin, as if she were the worst maide in all the house,
never ceasing or giving over, till all things were in due and decent
order, as best beseemed in such a case. After all which was done, the
Marquesse, having invited all the Ladies of the Countrey, to be
present at so great a Feast: when the marriage day came, <i>Grizelda</i>,
in her gowne of Countrey gray, gave them welcome, in honourable
manner, and graced them all with very cheerefull countenance.</p>

<p><i>Gualtiero</i> the Marquesse, who had caused his two children to be
nobly nourished at <i>Bologna</i>, with a neere kinswoman of his, who
had married with one of the Counts of <i>Panago</i>, his daughter being
now aged twelve yeares old, and some-what more, as also the Son
about sixe or seven. He sent a Gentleman expresly to his kindred,
to have them come and visite him at <i>Saluzza</i>, bringing his daughter
and Sonne with them, attended in very honourable manner, and
publishing every where as they came along, that the young Virgin
(knowne to none but himselfe and them) should be the Wife to
the Marquesse, and that onely was the cause of her comming. The
Gentleman was not slacke, in the execution of the trust reposed in
him: but having made convenient preparation, with the kindred,
Sonne, daughter, and a worthy company attending on them, arrived
at <i>Saluzza</i> about dinner time, where wanted no resort, from
all neighbouring parts round about, to see the comming of the
Lord Marquesses new Spouse.</p>

<p>By the Lords and Ladies she was joyfullly entertained, and comming
into the great Hall, where the Tables were readily covered:
<i>Grizelda</i>, in her homely Country habite, humbled her selfe before
her, saying. Gracious welcome, to the new elected Spouse of the
Lord Marquesse.</p>

<p>All the Ladies there present, who had very earnestly importuned
<i>Gualtiero</i> (but in vaine) that <i>Grizelda</i>, might better be shut up
in some Chamber, or else to lend her the wearing of any other garments,
which formerly had been her owne, because she should not
be so poorely seene among strangers: being seated at the Tables,
she waited on them very serviceably. The young Virgin was observed
by every one, who spared not to say; that the Marquesse had
made an excellent change: but above them all, <i>Grizelda</i> did most
commend her, and so did her brother likewise, as young as he was,
yet not knowing her to be his Sister.</p>

<p>Now was the Marquesse sufficiently satisfied in his soule, that
he had seene so much as he desired, concerning the patience of his
Wife, who in so many hart-grieving trials, was never noated so
much as to alter her countenance. And being absolutely perswaded,
that this proceeded not from any want of understanding in
her, because he knew her to be singularly wise: he thought it high
time now, to free her from these afflicting oppressions, and give her
such assurance as she ought to have. Wherefore, commanding her
into his presence, openly before all his assembled friends, smiling on
her, he said. What thinkst thou <i>Grizelda</i> of our new chosen Spouse?
My Lord (quoth she) I like her exceeding well, and if she be so wise,
as she is faire (which verely I thinke she is) I make no doubt but
you shall live with her, as the onely happy man of the world. But I
humbly entreat your honour (if I have any power in me to prevaile
by) that you would not give her such cutting and unkind language,
as you did to your other wife: for I cannot thinke her armed with
such patience, as should (indeed) support them: as wel in regard she
is much younger, as also her more delicate breeding and education,
whereas she who you had before, was brought up in continuall toile
and travaile.</p>

<p>When the Marquesse perceyved, that <i>Grizelda</i> beleeved verily,
this young daughter of hers should be his wife, and answered him in
so honest and modest manner: he commanded her to sit downe by
him, and saide. <i>Grizelda</i>, it is now more then fitte time, that thou
shouldst taste the fruite of thy long admired patience, and that they
who have thought me cruell, harsh and uncivill natured, should at
length observe, that I have done nothing basely, or unadvisedly.
For this was a worke premeditated before, for enstructing thee,
what it is to be a married wife, and to let them know (whosoever
they be) how to take and keepe a wife. Which hath begotten (to
me) perpetuall joy and happinesse, so long as I have a day to live
with thee: a matter whereof I stoode before greatly in feare, and
which (in marriage I thought) would never happen to me.</p>

<p>It is not unknown to thee, in how many kinds (for my first proofe)
I gave thee harsh and unpleasing speeches, which drawing no discontentment
from thee, either in lookes, words, or behaviour, but
rather such comfort as my soule desired, and so in my other succeedings
afterward: in one minute now, I purpose to give thee that
consolation, which I bereft thee of in many tempestuous stormes,
and make a sweet restauration, for all thy former sower sufferinges.
My faire and dearly affected <i>Grizelda</i>, shee whom thou supposest
for my new elected Spouse, with a glad and cheerfull hart, imbrace
for thine owne daughter, and this also her Brother, beeing both of
them thy children and mine, in common opinion of the vulgar multitude,
imagined to be (by my command) long since slaine. I am thy
honourable Lord and Husband, who doth, and will love thee farre
above all women else in the world; giving thee justly this deserved
praise and commendation, That no man living hath the like Wife,
as I have.</p>

<p>So, sweetly kissing her infinitely, and hugging her joyfullly in his
armes (the teares now streaming like new-let-loose Rivers, downe
her faire face, which no disaster before could force from her) hee
brought her, and seated her by her daughter, who was not a little amazed
at so rare an alteration. Shee having (in zeale of affection)
kissed and embraced them both, all else there present being clearely
resolved from the former doubt which too long deluded them; the
Ladies arose jocondly from the tables, and attending on <i>Grizelda</i>
to her Chamber, in signe of a more successefull augury to follow:
tooke off her poor contemptible rags, and put on such costly robes,
which (as Lady Marchionesse) she used to weare before.</p>

<p>Afterward, they waited on her into the Hall againe, being their
true Soveraigne Lady and Mistresse, as she was no lesse in her poorest
Garments; where all rejoycing for the new restored Mother, &amp;
happy recovery of so noble a son and daughter, the Festivall continued
many months after. Now every one thought the Marquesse
to be a noble and wise Prince, though somewhat sharpe and unsufferable,
in the severe experiences made of his wife: but (above al) they
reputed <i>Grizelda</i>, to be a most wise, patient, &amp; vertuous Lady. The
Count of <i>Panago</i>, within few daies after returned backe to <i>Bologna</i>;
and the Lord Marques, fetching home old <i>Janiculo</i> from his country
drudgery, to live with him (as his Father in law) in his Princely
Palace, gave him honourable maintenance, wherein hee long continued,
and ended his daies. Afterward, he matched his daughter in a
Noble marriage: he and <i>Grizelda</i> living long time together, in the
highest honour that possibly could be.</p>

<p>What can now be saide to the contrary, but that poore Country
Cottages, may yeeld as divine &amp; excellent spirits, as the most stately
and Royall mansions, which breed and bring uppe some, more
worthy to be Hog-rubbers, then hold any soveraignty over men?
Where is any other (beside <i>Grizelda</i>) who not only without a wet
eye, but imboldned by a valiant and invincible courage: that can
suffer the sharpe rigours, and (never the like heard of proofes) made
by the Marquesse? Perhaps he might have met with another, who
would have quitted him in a contrary kinde, and for thrusting her
forth of doores in her smocke, could have found better succor somewhere
else, rather then walke so nakedly in the cold streets.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Dioneus</i> having thus ended his Novel, and the Ladies delivering
their severall judgements, according to their owne
fancies, some holding one conceite, others leaning to the
contrary; one blaming this thing, and another commending that,
the King lifting his eyes to heaven, and seeing the Sun began to fal
low, by rising of the Evening Starre; without arising from his seat,
spake as followeth. Discreet Ladies, I am perswaded you know sufficiently,
that the sense and understanding of us mortals, consisteth
not onely (as I think) by preserving in memory things past, or knowledge
of them present; but such as both by the one and other, know
how to foresee future occasions, are worthily thought wise, and of
no common capacity.</p>

<p>It will be (to morrow) fifteene dayes, since we departed from the
City of <i>Florence</i>, to come hither for our pastime and comfort, the
conservation of our lives, and support of our health, by avoyding
those melanchollies, griefes, and anguishes, which we beheld daylie
in our City, since the pestilentiall visitation beganne there, wherein
(by my judgement) we have done well and honestly. Albeit some
light Novels, perhaps attractive to a little wantonnes, as some say,
and our Joviall feasting with good cheare, singing and dancing, may
seeme matters inciting to incivility, especially in weake and shallow
understandings. But I have neither seene, heard, or knowne, any
acte, word, or whatsoever else, either on your part or ours, justly
deserving to be blamed: but all has bin honest, as in a sweete and
hermonious concord, such as might well beseeme the communitie
of Brethren and Sisters; which assuredly, as well in regard of you,
as us, hath much contented me.</p>

<p>And therefore, least by over-long consuetude, something should
take life, which might be converted to a bad construction, &amp; by our
country demourance for so many dayes, some captious conceit may
wrest out an ill imagination; I am of the minde (if yours be the like)
seeing each of us hath had the honour, which now remaineth still on
me: that it is very fitting for us, to returne thither from whence we
came. And so much the rather, because this sociable meeting of
ours, which already hath wonne the knowledge of many dwellers
here about us, should not grow to such an increase, as might make
our purposed pastime offensive to us. In which respect (if you allow
of my advise) I wil keepe the Crowne till our departing hence; the
which I intend shal be to morrow: but if you determine otherwise,
I am the man ready to make my resignation.</p>

<p>Many imaginations passed amongst the Ladies, and likewise the
men, but yet in the end, they reputed the Kings counsell to bee the
best and wisest, concluding to do as he thought convenient. Whereupon,
hee called the Master of the housholde, and conferred with
him, of the businesse belonging to the next morning, and then gave
the company leave to rise. The Ladies and the rest, when they were
risen, fel some to one kinde of recreation, and others as their fancies
served them, even as (before) they had done. And when Supper
time came, they dispatcht it in very loving manner. Then they began
to play on instruments, sing and dance, and Madame <i>Lauretta</i>
leading the dance: the King commaunded Madame <i>Fiammetta</i> to

<span class="i0">If Love were free from Jealousie,<br /></span>

<p>So soone as Madam <i>Fiammetta</i> had ended her Song; <i>Dioneus</i>,
who sate by her, smiling said. Truly Madam, you may do us a great
courtesie, to express your selfe more plainly to us all, least (thorow
ignorance) the possession may be imposed on your selfe, and so you
remaine the more offended. After the Song was past, divers other
were sung beside, and it now drawing wel-neere midnight, by the
Kings command, they all went to bed. And when new day appeared,
and all the world awaked out of sleepe, the Master of the Houshold
having sent away the carriages; they returned (under the conduct
of their discreet King) to <i>Florence</i>, where the three Gentlemen
left the seven Ladies at the Church of <i>Santa Maria Novella</i>, from
whence they went with them at the first. And having parted with
kinde salutations; the Gentlemen went whether themselves best
pleased, and the Ladies repaired home to their houses.</p>
